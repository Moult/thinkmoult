<p>This is a free 3D model of a generic round plug. All sorts of electrical
appliances have plugs and so this is a generic one you can use anywhere. Most of
them are made of black rubber, which I've measured here.</p>
<p>The pins are not included in this model, and neither is the wire. This is
because the plug is likely to be plugged into a socket. If you need a socket in
Australia, there is a 3D model of an <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/gpo-double-australia-free-3d-model.html">Australian double
GPO</a>. Wires vary
based on what appliance you have, and so you will need to model the wire
yourself.</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>The colours have been calibrated with Macbethcal but the specularity and
roughness values are guessed.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This Radiance model follows the <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/proposed-radiance-filesystem-hierarchy-standard.html">Radiance Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard</a>. As
such, please run <code>make lib</code> to build the Radiance mesh file. Once done, you can
use this in your scene by:</p>
<pre><code>!xform lib/plug-round-generic/obj/model.rad
</code></pre>
<h2>Authors</h2>
<p>This model was created by <a href="https://thinkmoult.com">Dion Moult</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a 3D printed monkey head using Blender.</p>
<p><img alt="Suzanne, the monkey mascot from Blender" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/IMG_4116.jpg"></p>
<p>It's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#Suzanne">Suzanne </a>! It's
Blender's mascot monkey 3D printed with a <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot</a>.
It's about 45x40x50mm from a 3mm black plastic spool, and sits on your desk on
on your keyboard staring at you with its docile eyes.</p>
<p>It's a little lumpy, mainly due to the low resolution of the printer, but a
little bit more planning could've improved it a little - as seen below:</p>

<p>You can see where the scaffolding was attached as well as where plastic
dripped down, causing some unevenness in the layering.</p>
<p>For the technically-inclined, the model was exported to <code>obj</code>, then re-exported
to <code>stl</code> in Rhino (because Blender's <code>stl</code> didn't seem to work), and then the
rest is standard as <a href="http://wiki.makerbot.com/how-to-print">documented here</a>.</p>

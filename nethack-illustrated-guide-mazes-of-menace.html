<p>NetHack is, without a doubt, the <a href="https://www.thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com/">greatest game you will ever
play</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by the creative adventures from Dungeons and Dragons, NetHack is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a> game first released in
1987, and still <a href="https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack">under active development</a>
35 years later. Most people are older than the games they play. For NetHack,
it's the other way around.</p>
<p>NetHack is a high-stakes, carefully executed, heist game. You have been heralded
since birth by your god to recover the stolen Amulet of Yendor. The reward:
eternal life as a demigod. The consequence of failure: death.</p>
<p>You begin as one of over 10 diverse races and roles. Play as the stereotypical
fantasy tropes: a hardy dwarven valkyrie, borne amongst the icy Northlands. Or
perhaps an elvish wizard, weak in strength but learned in the mystic arts. Or a
ranger, trained in bow and arrow deep within the forests. For a twist, play as
bumbling tourist, snapping photos with your expensive camera and oblivious to
the carnage that surrounds you. Or maybe one of the secretive samurai, or
Shaolin monks, training to become a martial arts grandmaster.</p>
<p>You are piously aligned with one of three possible dieties: the gods of Law,
Neutrality, or Chaos. Moloch, our antagonist, has stolen the most powerful
artifact of the gods: The Amulet of Yendor. The Amulet has been hidden in the
furthest depths of Gehennom. Your journey begins at the entrance of the Dungeons
of Doom, an ancient ruins delving deep into the earth.</p>
<p><img alt="An entry into the Dungeons of Doom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/0-0-entrance.png"></p>
<p>What makes NetHack stand the test of time is the sheer depth and replayability.
Set in an open world, the world is procedurally generated each time you enter,
so no two adventures are the same. The locations, distances, objects,
descriptions, all change so you will have to relearn how the world works. There
is no set path: you may interact with your objects and surroundings in
surprising ways that may result in creative solutions to sticky problems. The
stories, characters, destinations are drawn from a diverse collection or lore
and cultures, combined into a unique experience, rich with references.</p>
<p>Choose a permutation of role, race, and religion, and enter into the unknown.</p>
<p><img alt="An elven ranger standing at the entrance of the dungeons" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/0-elvenranger.png"></p>
<p><img alt="A saddled knight just outside the entrance of the dungeons" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/0-knight.png"></p>
<p><img alt="An orc barbarian standing at the entrance of the dungeons" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/0-orcbarb.png"></p>
<p><img alt="A wizard entering the dungeons" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/0-wizard.png"></p>
<p>The game is divided into four stages: early, middle, late, and end game,
presenting you with 4, 6, 8, and 10 milestones respectively.</p>
<h2>Early game</h2>
<p>The theme of the early game is survival. You are not welcome. Everything is
foreign. Which foods are safe to eat, what potions may be quaffed, what
incantations may be evoked, are all unknown. The local fauna have a spectrum of
different abilities, with one common purpose: to kill you.</p>
<p>Caution is the word of the day. Discretion is the better part of valor. You are
new here, and every decision you make with the little resources you have will
determine whether you live to see the four landmarks that will prepare you for
your journey.</p>
<h3>The Gnomish Mines</h3>
<p>A branching tunnel out of the dungeons leads to the Gnomish mines. A dimly lit
series of caverns have been slowly excavated by the local gnome population. As
you venture deeper you will discover the grand underground metropolis of
Minetown.</p>
<p>Stocked with shops, temples, and residences, you will find brief refuge and
basic supplies.</p>
<p><img alt="The streets and shops of minetown, built into the caves of the Gnomish Mines" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-1-minetown1.png"></p>
<p>But perhaps the true jewel of Minetown is far deeper beyond the mines. Hidden at
Mine's End deep underground the town is a luckstone, a nondescript gray stone
that brings fortune upon its carrier. Should you find it, it is a token you will
likely carry until the very end.</p>
<p><img alt="Deep underground, the luckstone lays hidden somewhere within Mine's End" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-1-minetown2.png"></p>
<h3>Delphi</h3>
<p>Outside the order of the Gnomish residence, you will delve deeper into the
Dungeons of Doom. One of these dungeons are not like the others. It is inhabited
by nagas and snakelike creatures. At its center, an oasis amongst the perils of
the dungeon, is Delphi.</p>
<p><img alt="The center of Delphi, a peaceful pause amidst the dungeons" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-2-oracle1.png"></p>
<p>Rays of light, trees, and peaceful fountains surround the Oracle, an ancient and
wise being as old as the Internet itself. The Oracle speaks in riddles, and will
guide you on your quest for the Amulet of Yendor.</p>
<p><img alt="The Oracle lives within Delphi and dispenses cryptic wisdom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-2-oracle2.png"></p>
<h3>Sokoban</h3>
<p>As you descend further, a side tunnel leads into a ruined tower built into the
cliffs of the dungeons. This is the tower of Sokoban, a Japanese relic with a
menagerie of dangerous creatures guarding a valuable relic at the uppermost
level.</p>
<p><img alt="A crumbling tower out the sides of the dungeons guards a valuable relic" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-3-sokoban1.png"></p>
<p>However the passages up the tunnel have long since crumbled away and you now
face a impasse at every floor. Sokoban conceals a careful mechanism of balanced
boulders to cross the chasms. Should you complete this ancient ritual, you may
bridge your way across the tower.</p>
<p><img alt="Carefully balanced boulders may be used to cross the chasms of Sokoban" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-3-sokoban2.png"></p>
<p>At the uppermost level, you will find your prize. It is not known what that
prize may be, but it is an object embued with an enchantment to prepare you for
the next stage of the game.</p>
<p><img alt="The top of Sokoban has an enchanted prize" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-3-sokoban3.png"></p>
<h3>The Big Room</h3>
<p>The Big Room, an homage to Carlsbad Caverns' largest cave chamber in North
America by volume, is the threshold between the early game and mid game.</p>
<p><img alt="The Big Room may take many forms" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-4-bigroom1.png"></p>
<p>The twisted and narrow passageways of the dungeon give way to a huge
cavernous space. An assortment of monsters have made this their territory, and
dwelling too long may find yourself surrounded by creatures.</p>
<p><img alt="A huge cavern with glowing crystals" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-4-bigroom2.png"></p>
<p>Here you will be put to the test of the early stage: can you truly survive in
the dungeons of doom? Are you fit to explore further?</p>
<p><img alt="A huge cavern with a bioluminescent central column" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/1-4-bigroom3.png"></p>
<h2>Mid game</h2>
<p>The aim of the mid game is to gather resources. The heist may be performed with
a variety of equipment, and it is your job to identify what's available and
combine them with the spoils of the early game to make sure you are suitably
equipped for the perils that lay ahead.</p>
<h3>Rogue</h3>
<p>As you step into the dungeon, you enter an older, more primitive world. This is
<a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Rogue_(game)">Rogue</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="The dungeon has no colour, as was the world in 1980" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-1-rogue1.png"></p>
<p>NetHack was first released in 1987. But NetHack didn't start in 1987, it was a
successor to the open-source game Hack in 1984, developed and distributed on
Usenet (hence the name NetHack).</p>
<p><img alt="Dungeons were simpler back then, with gridded layouts" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-1-rogue2.png"></p>
<p>Hack was itself a clone of the closed source game Rogue, released in 1980 that
would soon inspire an entire genre of gaming, which would then inspire many
modern games to come.</p>
<p><img alt="Take a pause, and break the fourth wall into the history of gaming itself" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-1-rogue3.png"></p>
<p>The dungeons here replicate the original Rogue, without colour, using the same
symbols and rules that the original game would play, as a modern tribute to the
origins of the dungeons that you now crawl.</p>
<p><img alt="An older, more primitive world" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-1-rogue4.png"></p>
<h3>Quest</h3>
<p>Beyond Rogue, you will receive a telepathic message from your ancient leader.
Who this leader is will depend on your role, a knight may be approached by King
Arthur himself, whereas a healer may be summoned by Hippocrates.</p>
<p><img alt="Your quest leader will open a portal to your homeland" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-01.png"></p>
<p>Your homeland and your peers are plagued with a problem. Like your leader, the
problem differs from role to role and it is your responsibility to discover what
evil has befallen.</p>
<p><img alt="The portal may be located anywhere in the dungeon, and lead to different places" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-02.png"></p>
<p>The Quest is a great journey upon which all seekers of the Amulet must embark.
The two adventures have become entwined, and it is said that the nemesis has an
ancient artifact within their possession, critical to the success of your
mission. This is a small silver bell, its powers yet to be revealed.</p>
<p><img alt="The portal leads to another adventure, its fate entwined with your own" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-03.png"></p>
<p>Your homeland itself varies from role to role, where the portal takes you, we
cannot say.</p>
<p><img alt="You must be ready before undertaking the quest" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-04.png"></p>
<p>Valkyries are brought back to the bitter cold, snow, and icy mountains. The
Shrine of Destiny is found there, where your leader, the Norn, awaits you.</p>
<p><img alt="The Shrine of Destiny is found in the snowy mountains" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-11.png"></p>
<p>Lord Surtur has taken the Orb of Fate and is unleashing Ragnarok. In places, the
snow and ice have been melted into steaming pools of water. Fumaroles and pools
of bubbling lava surround your homeland.</p>
<p><img alt="Something is very wrong, lava is erupting" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-12.png"></p>
<p>A ranger will find themselves in an ancient forest grove. A herd of centaurs are
led by Orion, your leader.</p>
<p><img alt="An ancient forest grove populated by centaurs" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-21.png"></p>
<p>In the caves of wumpus under the camp, Scorpius has stolen the Longbow of Diana.</p>
<p><img alt="You must journey beneath the camp to find Scorpius" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-22.png"></p>
<p>A monk will return to the Monastery of Chan-Sune and will meet your former
teacher, the Grand Master.</p>
<p><img alt="The Monastery of Chan-Sune" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-31.png"></p>
<p>Despite the peaceful appearances, Earth Elementals are rising and slaying the
students. You will travel to the Monastery of the Earth-Lord to fight their
leader.</p>
<p><img alt="The Eyes of the Overworld bring astral visions to the wearer in the Monstary
of the Earth-Lord" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-2-quest-32.png"></p>
<h3>Fort Ludios</h3>
<p>Deeper in the dungeon past your Quest, you may or may not stumble upon a secret
stash of gold, jewels, and treasures.</p>
<p><img alt="A cache of treasures may be found hidden in the dungeons" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-3-fort1a.png"></p>
<p>The location of this treasure is unknown. It is one of many hidden vaults
containing riches interspersed throughout the dungeons and guarded by
otherworldly soldiers.</p>
<p><img alt="The vault is hidden and guarded" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-3-fort1b.png"></p>
<p>But this vault is not like the others, for it contains a magic portal to Fort
Ludios itself.</p>
<p><img alt="Within the vault are not just treasures, but a portal to another realm" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-3-fort1c.png"></p>
<p>Fort Ludios, a fabled land of riches is ruled by King Croesus. It is the Fort
Knox of the dungeons, housing gold beyond measure.</p>
<p><img alt="Within the vault are not just treasures, but a portal to another realm" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-3-fort2.png"></p>
<p>Guarded by dragons and the armies of Croesus himself, it offers enough gold to
pay for all the spoils in the dungeon, but be warned that your mission to
recover the Amulet of Yendor is not earned through money.</p>
<p><img alt="Enough money to hang yourself, but money is not the only thing you need" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-3-fort3.png"></p>
<h3>Medusa's Island</h3>
<p>As you descend further, the magical nature of the dungeons reveal that you are
not merely going deeper into the world, you are traveling through realms and
time. You find yourself at the edge of a swamp, the home of the gorgon Medusa.</p>
<p><img alt="You must cross water to reach Medusa, infested with snakes and monsters" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-4-medusa1.png"></p>
<p>Perseus has failed, and it is now your turn. Somewhere across the swamp is her
island, where stone crumbles to sand. You must face her and prevail, or be
turned to stone.</p>
<p><img alt="Caution to all who enter Medusa's Island" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-4-medusa2.png"></p>
<h3>The Castle</h3>
<p>Medusa is the guardian of the foolish mortals who seek the Amulet below. Below
Medusa, the dungeons are no longer dungeons, the stone itself warps and twists
until you find yourself at an ancient citadel, representing the last bastion of
mortal resistance against the netherworld.</p>
<p><img alt="The castle, a bastion against the netherworld" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-5-castle1.png"></p>
<p>The castle is barred. The drawbridge is up. The entrance blocked by a moat of
vicious sea creatures. The castle will not open, and you shall not enter.</p>
<p><img alt="A secret melody may twist the ancient tumblers and gears" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-5-castle2.png"></p>
<p>Within the castle are armies and supplies to last the centuries. But hidden
within are also dragons, hiding in the shadows for the unwary assailant.</p>
<p><img alt="Beware, for here be dragons" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-5-castle3.png"></p>
<p>In the very core of the castle, you will find that the castle is not only
guarding the mortal world outside and the dungeons beyond. The castle was built
around ancient trapdoors that lead past the mortal realms and into the
supernatural. Dragons bar the way, such that the dead do not rise and enter the
land of the living.</p>
<p><img alt="The dragons guard an ancient trapdoor" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-5-castle4.png"></p>
<h3>The Valley of the Dead</h3>
<p>As you fall through the trapdoor, you leave the mortal realm. This is the space
between worlds: the Valley of the Dead, and you must cross it.</p>
<p><img alt="A barren landscape leading to the afterlife" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-6-valley1.png"></p>
<p>You are surrounded by tombs. You may read the epitaphs, should they help you in
your mission for the Amulet of Yendor. Prepare to enter the late game.</p>
<p><img alt="You walk through a quiet graveyard" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/2-6-valley2.png"></p>
<h2>Late game</h2>
<p>You're alive, and you have resources. The late game is now about deliberate
planning and preparation.</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that you have everything you need to steal the Amulet of
Yendor. You will have to prepare for the unknown, and have enough tricks up your
sleeve to bypass the many obstacles guarding the amulet, and enough ways to
escape when the situations grow out of control. You will need remedies for
illness, food, methods to detect enchantments, maps, and raw strength.</p>
<h3>Asmodeus' Lair</h3>
<p>At the end of the Valley is the entrance of Gehennom. Beware, unspeakable evil
and cruelty lies ahead.</p>
<p><img alt="The tunnel into Gehennom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-1-asmodeus1.png"></p>
<p>Gehennom is filled with fire, smoke, and evil creatures and demons. But perhaps
most characteristic is that Gehennom itself is warped into a maze, where you
either find the way through, or perish.</p>
<p><img alt="The corridors of Gehennom twist and turn into a maze" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-1-asmodeus2.png"></p>
<p>As you descend, the labrynth changes, some wider, some thinner. Demons guard the
passages, forcing you to fight or flee.</p>
<p><img alt="The labrynth is never the same" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-1-asmodeus3.png"></p>
<p>Nestled within the maze is the Lair of Asmodeus. A suave yet unsettling demon
prince who may offer you a price for passage. Asmodeus knows you seek the
amulet, and such a mission does not pass lightly through his lair.</p>
<p><img alt="Asmodeus himself will greet you as you enter Gehennom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-1-asmodeus4.png"></p>
<h3>Juiblex's Lair</h3>
<p>Deeper still in Gehennom, you will find yourself in a swamp. Crueler and fouler
than the waters of Medusa's island, this is the swamp of Juiblex, the demon
lord.</p>
<p><img alt="The swamp of Juiblex is covered is slime and formless monsters" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-2-juiblex1.png"></p>
<p>Beware where you tread, for Juiblex himself has no form, and may arise from
anywhere in the swamp.</p>
<p><img alt="A misstep into the swamp may provoke Juiblex" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-2-juiblex2.png"></p>
<p>You must make your way through to the other end of the swamp, where you may
continue your journey. The air is diseased, and should you fail, you will be
engulfed and join the swamp itself.</p>
<p><img alt="Try not to get engulfed" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-2-juiblex3.png"></p>
<h3>Baalzebub's Lair</h3>
<p>Devoted to decay, destruction, demoralization, hysteria and panic, you shall
encounter Baalzebub, demon prince of the flies.</p>
<p><img alt="Swarms of flies surround Baalzebub's lair" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-3-baalzebub1.png"></p>
<p>Baalzebub may also propose a bribe, but the price will be high.</p>
<p><img alt="Deep within Baalzebub's lair, you will find the way ahead" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-3-baalzebub2.png"></p>
<p>Baalzebub lives within the rotting carcass of a huge fly, hidden within, is the
passage through Gehennom.</p>
<p><img alt="Deep within his lair, you will find the way ahead" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-3-baalzebub3.png"></p>
<h3>Orcus-Town</h3>
<p>As you leave the maze, you find yourself standing at the edge of a sprawling
city: Orcus-Town.</p>
<p><img alt="A vast cursed city deep within Gehennom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-4-orcus1.png"></p>
<p>Orcus-Town is a dark place, with abandoned homes and descecrated temples.</p>
<p><img alt="The walls of the dwellings and crumbling" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-4-orcus2.png"></p>
<p>Orcus, the demon prince, rules over the town and may be found deep within.</p>
<p><img alt="Deep within Orcus-Town, you will find Orcus" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-4-orcus3.png"></p>
<p>You may also find shady dealers and cursed wares. But be warned, some of these
objects may not be as they seem ...</p>
<p><img alt="Extortionate prices and suspicious goods are commonplace in Orcus-Town" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-4-orcus4.png"></p>
<h3>Vlad's Tower</h3>
<p>Rising from the rocks, fire, and smoke of Gehennom is Vlad's Tower. Vlad, a
vampire, one of the most wretched, heinous, and depraved characters has taken up
residence in the midst of hell.</p>
<p><img alt="A tower, rising from the grounds of Gehennom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-5-vlad1.png"></p>
<p>Vlad, a covetous character, has many goods stored in his tower. At the top, you
will face Vlad himself on his throne.</p>
<p><img alt="A charred, ashen tower impervious to the flames of Gehennom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-5-vlad2.png"></p>
<p>One of the treasures Vlad holds is the Candelabrum of Invocation, a unique
candelabrum said to provide enough light to walk you through the elemental
planes.</p>
<p><img alt="Vlad holds the sacred Candelabrum of Invocation, which you must find" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-5-vlad3.png"></p>
<h3>The Wizard's Tower</h3>
<p>You find two small refuges from the heat of Gehennom, a lake amidst the flame
and smoke. Rising from both lakes is another tower. This time constructed rather
than hewn from the rock.</p>
<p><img alt="A lake houses a powerful and mighty wizard, the Wizard of Yendor" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-6-tower1.png"></p>
<p>One of these towers is abandoned, whereas the other is the home of the legendary
Wizard of Yendor himself. Weary of lesser mortals, spurning all human company,
the Wizard lives in the depths of the Earth, taking with him the dreadful Book
of the Dead. You must find the true residence of the Wizard, and cross the lake.</p>
<p><img alt="Two such towers exist, one is abandoned, and the other is the true tower" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-6-tower2.png"></p>
<h3>The Wizard of Yendor</h3>
<p>You must ascend the tower, fighting the various creatures that lurk within.</p>
<p><img alt="The base of the tower, with chambers filled with evil creatures" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-7-yendor1.png"></p>
<p>Midway up the tower, you will find a contingent of evil creatures, pets of the
Wizard of Yendor.</p>
<p><img alt="A huge arena of evil creatures await you" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-7-yendor2.png"></p>
<p>At the top, surrounded by a circle of water, you will find the wizard meditating
within. You must duel him, but the wizard cannot truly die. You may vanquish his
body, but he will always return.</p>
<p><img alt="The wizard waits within the central spine of the top floor of the tower" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-7-yendor3.png"></p>
<h3>The Vibrating Square</h3>
<p>You are ready. The Wizard of Yendor is no more, and it is time for the heist to
begin. The Amulet of Yendor resides within the lowermost depths of Gehennom, in
Moloch's Sanctum.</p>
<p><img alt="An ancient magical glyph embedded into the ground" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-8-vibsq1.png"></p>
<p>However access to the Sanctum is hidden through an ancient enchantment. The
Oracle will guide you to the entrance: a mystical square, hidden at the end of
Gehennom.</p>
<p><img alt="You will find the square at the lowermost depth of Gehennom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-8-vibsq2.png"></p>
<p>The Vibrating Square is hidden. The location may be anywhere and it may look
like anything. You may only discover it through standing directly above it. When
you do, the ground will vibrate and the square shall reveal itself.</p>
<p><img alt="The square is hidden and may only be revealed by standing above" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-8-vibsq3.png"></p>
<p>The Vibrating Square is protected with an enchantment. To enter through the
square, you must perform an invocation, as revealed by the Oracle.</p>
<p><img alt="You must perform the invocation to proceed" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/3-8-vibsq4.png"></p>
<h2>End game</h2>
<p>Now is the time. You must retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, or die in the attempt.</p>
<h3>Invocation</h3>
<p>You now have prepared the three critical items required to enter Moloch's
sanctum: the bell, book, and candle job.</p>
<p>The first is the Silver Bell, from your Quest Nemesis in the mid game. Ringing
it will produce a pure sound to announce thee to the sanctum below.</p>
<p><img alt="The Silver Bell, from your Quest nemesis" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-1-invocation1.png"></p>
<p>The second is the Candelabrum of Invocation, from Vlad. The light from which
will show you the way through the depths past Gehennom itself to the Sanctum of
the evil god Moloch.</p>
<p><img alt="The Candelabrum of Invocation, coveted by Vlad" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-1-invocation2.png"></p>
<p>The third is the Book of the Dead, from the Wizard of Yendor. The terrible runes
when read, will cause the earth to tremble mightily and crumble away, to descend
to the Sanctum.</p>
<p><img alt="The Book of the Dead, guarded by the Wizard of Yendor" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-1-invocation3.png"></p>
<p>You ring the bell.</p>
<p><img alt="A pure sound is heard" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-1-invocation4.png"></p>
<p>You light the candelabrum.</p>
<p><img alt="You see past the depths of Gehennom" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-1-invocation5.png"></p>
<p>You recite the book.</p>
<p><img alt="The ground crumbles away and you are surrounded by water and towers of flame" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-1-invocation6.png"></p>
<h3>Sanctum</h3>
<p>There is no more return. You enter Moloch's Sanctum.</p>
<p><img alt="Moloch's Sanctum is a place of pure evil" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-2-sanctum1.png"></p>
<p>This is a place of pure evil, beyond law, neutrality, and chaos. Within is the
Temple to Moloch surrounded by flame, where the high priest of Moloch holds the
fabled Amulet of Yendor itself.</p>
<p><img alt="A temple to Moloch holds the Amulet of Yendor" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-2-sanctum2.png"></p>
<p>Fight, and win. Get the amulet!</p>
<h3>Rise</h3>
<p>As with any heist, getting the Amulet is not enough. You must now leave the
Dungeons of Doom.</p>
<p><img alt="You must leave the sanctum with the amulet" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-3-rise1.png"></p>
<p>You must rise through the fiery mazes of Gehennom. The magic of the Amulet will
inhibit your progress, plunging you further down back into the Sanctum even as
you try to climb up.</p>
<p><img alt="Even as you rise, the amulet holds you back" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-3-rise2.png"></p>
<p>You find yourself back at the entrance of the Dungeons of Doom, but you do not
see the sky and earth as you entered it. The Amulet's power is calling your god
to you. You rise, and go beyond the planes of life.</p>
<p><img alt="The entrance of the Dungeons of Doom is warped, and no longer lead to the
land of the living" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-3-rise3.png"></p>
<h3>Plane of Earth</h3>
<p>The Amulet transports you to the first of the four elemental planes: The Plane
of Earth.</p>
<p><img alt="The Plane of Earth is a small network of caves" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-4-earth1.png"></p>
<p>You are is a small underground chamber. You must dig your way through to other
small cavernous pockets within the earth.</p>
<p><img alt="You must dig between the caverns" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-4-earth2.png"></p>
<p>Even as you dig, rubble transforms into raw elemental beings, who are not happy
to find a stranger in their plane. But you must dig, for you must find the
portal through to the next elemental plane.</p>
<p><img alt="Hidden in the earth is a portal to the next elemental plane" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-4-earth3.png"></p>
<h3>Plane of Air</h3>
<p>The Plane of Air finds you falling endlessly through empty space. There is no
ground, just clouds, storm, lighting, and thunder.</p>
<p><img alt="Clouds, storm, lighting, and thunder form the Plane of Air" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-5-air1.png"></p>
<p>Walking through the clouds is perilous and filled with air elementals, who
surround you as a hurricane does.</p>
<p><img alt="Air elementals hide within the clouds waiting to ambush you" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-5-air2.png"></p>
<p>Hidden within the clouds, an invisible portal will bring you to the next
elemental plane.</p>
<p><img alt="Hidden in the clouds is a portal to the next elemental plane" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-5-air3.png"></p>
<h3>Plane of Fire</h3>
<p>Surrounded by flame and lava with flames falling from the sky, you find yourself
in the Plane of Fire.</p>
<p><img alt="The ground burns in the Plane of Fire" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-6-fire1.png"></p>
<p>Fire elementals emerge from the ground, scorching their way through to you and
leaving a trail of noxious fumes.</p>
<p><img alt="Towers of flame erupt" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-6-fire2.png"></p>
<p>One of these towers of flame is not like the others. One of these is a portal to
the next elemental plane.</p>
<p><img alt="Hidden in the flame is a portal to the next elemental plane" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-6-fire3.png"></p>
<h3>Plane of Water</h3>
<p>You float within a huge air bubble. The Plane of Water is pure water, save for
supernatural air bubbles that hint at the treacherous currents that pull you
across the plane.</p>
<p><img alt="You are encased in a large air bubble floating around infinite water" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-7-water1.png"></p>
<p>The bubbles coalesce and split continuously, and you must hop from bubble to
bubble plagued by Water Elementals.</p>
<p><img alt="Quickly jump from bubble to bubble, lest you drown" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-7-water2.png"></p>
<p>One of these bubbles houses an invisible portal, to the final plane.</p>
<p><img alt="Hidden in a bubble is a portal to the next elemental plane" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-7-water3.png"></p>
<h3>The Astral Plane</h3>
<p>Beyond the Elemental Planes is the Astral Plane, the plane beyond the physical
elements, and the final frontier where beyond lies the gods themselves.</p>
<p><img alt="The Astral plane is the final frontier from the physical to the realm of the
gods" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-8-astral1.png"></p>
<p>The astral plane is the home of the angels, the highest priests who serve the
gods themselves, and yourself. The incarnations of the adventurer you might have
been.</p>
<p><img alt="Three chambers await you, one to the left, one straight ahead, and one to the
right" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-8-astral2.png"></p>
<p>None of them are happy to see you. The Amulet of Yendor possesses powers that
mere mortals can scarcely comprehend. You are not worthy of it.</p>
<p><img alt="Which will you take?" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-8-astral3.png"></p>
<h3>The High Altars</h3>
<p>The three chambers hold the antithesis of Moloch's Temple in the Sanctum. One
is the Temple of Law, the other is the Temple of Neutrality, and the final is
the Temple of Chaos.</p>
<p>Your pious alignment will guide you to the right temple, but guarding the three
temples are the Riders: horsemen of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>The Temple of Law is guarded by Famine, whose very touch causes starvation and
crops to wither.</p>
<p><img alt="The lawful altar is bathed in white light from above" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-9-altar1.png"></p>
<p>The Temple of Neutrality is guarded by Pestilence, whose touch causes sickness,
disease, and terminal illness.</p>
<p><img alt="The neutral altar is a grey void through which you may inspect" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-9-altar2.png"></p>
<p>The Temple of Chaos is guarded by Death, whose embrace brings death to you.</p>
<p><img alt="The chaotic altar is a black puncture through the astral fabric" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-9-altar3.png"></p>
<h3>Ascend</h3>
<p>The fourth horseman is <strong>You</strong>. You are <strong>War</strong>.</p>
<p>Your battle is victorious. You stand having travelled through the depths of the
Earth and beyond, with your victims claimed by Death. You produce the Amulet of
Yendor and call upon your god with your offering.</p>
<p><img alt="You are bathed in radiance ..." src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/4-9-offer.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An invisible choir sings, and you are bathed in radiance...
"Mortal, thou hast done well!"
"In return for thy service, I grant thee the gift of Immortality!"
You ascend to the status of Demigod...</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed reading my creative interpretation and illustrated guide
to NetHack. All images were generated through the DALL-E AI and attempt to
reflect what ASCII and plaintext descriptions allude to as best as possible. You
can right click and view any image to see the higher resolution. I've done some
minor image editing to improve the generated images on occasion.</p>
<p>Images purposely omit all characters and monsters, instead focusing on the
environs to preserve some imagination.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is full of spoilers. But if you're reading down here either your
mousewheel is broken or you know that already.</p>
<p>If you haven't played NetHack before, here's some screenshots of what playing
might look like from my first ascension. This uses a curses interface which
makes NetHack relatively modern (though it may not seem like it, if you've never
played a command line game before). Others may use different interfaces and
colours.</p>

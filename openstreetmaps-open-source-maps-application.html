<p>Recently I've been interested in an initiative known as
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMaps</a>. Launched in 2004,
OpenStreetMaps is the open-source equivalent of Google Maps, and
functions largely like how Wikipedia does (and in fact was inspired by
Wikipedia) - it's a map of the world drawn completely by volunteers and
open-source enthusiasts.</p>
<p><img alt="OpenStreetMaps world map" src="osm-world-map.png"></p>
<p>You might've already seen OSM in action. Below it's used by default in
the privacy-friendly search engine
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, other wiki-based projects like
<a href="https://wikivoyage.org/">WikiVoyage</a>, and many games use it as a base
layer, such as Pokemon Go.</p>
<p><img alt="PokemonGo uses OpenStreetMaps as a base layer" src="pokemon-go.png"></p>
<p>You've probably used Google Maps before and have it installed on your
phone to help you drive to places with the GPS. You may have also played
with Bing Maps which essentially does the same thing. At first glance
OpenStreetMaps is purely a clone: you can zoom in and out, look at
street names and see buildings, and have it tell you how to drive to a
destination. It's not that exciting, and isn't worth talking about.</p>
<p>However if you were a user of OSM, occasionally you might notice areas
of the map where volunteers have gone above and beyond to draw details
of the environment that other maps will not. Things like individual
driveways, articulated building outlines, kerbside grass, wheelchair
accessible walkways and kerb ramps, and individual bush and tree
locations, fences, and parking niches. Zooming in we can identify storm
drains, streetlamps, water taps and park benches. This level of detail
is possible because the map is created by people who are genuinely
interested and express a love and care in their work. The example below
is in Brisbane, Australia, largely by a fellow called ThorstenE.</p>
<p><img alt="OpenStreetMaps example in Brisbane, Australia" src="osm-brisbane.png"></p>
<p>Where OSM really excels is as an open-data resource. Usually, you are
only limited to raster map images produced by Google Maps and Bing, but
aren't allowed to access the underlying database of geographic and
vector information. In contrast, because the data in OSM's database is
free for everyone, specialist maps can easily be created. Take for
example the extensive mapping of skiing and snowboarding tracks in Oslo,
Norway provided by <a href="http://www.opensnowmap.org/">OpenSnowMap</a>...</p>
<p><img alt="OpenSnowMaps" src="opensnowmaps.png"></p>
<p>... alternatively there is the <a href="http://whitewater.quaker.eu.org/">Whitewater rafting
map</a> in the UK ...</p>
<p><img alt="Open Whitewater Rafting maps" src="openwhitewatermaps.png"></p>
<p>... and the <a href="https://opencyclemap.org/">OpenCycleMap</a> which maps the
world's bicycle routes, and shows the incredible culture of pedestrian
and cycling friendly urban planning in the Netherlands.</p>
<p><img alt="OpenCycleMaps example" src="opencyclemaps.png"></p>
<p>OSM also helps lead the way in humanitarian mapping. When a flood, fire,
earthquake or other natural disaster occurs, existing maps provided by
Google and Bing are no longer current. Mappers need to create new maps
to allow disaster relief teams to coordinate their efforts, target
houses for rescues efficiently, or to know what routes relief
organisations can take to navigate the terrain. This work is done by the
excellent <a href="https://www.hotosm.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>. It
also includes non natural disasters, such as mapping demographics and
environmental issues related to poverty elimination, gender equality,
refugee response strategies, public disease outbreaks, clean energy, and
water and sanitation. As one current example, right this minute the
Monsoon rains have caused severe flooding in the Kurunagala and Puttalam
districts of Sri Lanka. A map is being prepared so that first
respondents and aid agencies can deliver relief supplies. A grid of
zones with their mapping progress is updated in real time below.</p>
<p><img alt="Humanitarian OpenStreetMaps Team map in Nepal" src="hotosm.png"></p>
<p>As an open-source creation, it doesn't data-mine your activity so you
can use it as a Maps application without privacy concerns, you can
download the raw vector so you can use it offline on your phone, and has
a conservative approach to licensing data that allow people who want to
embed OSM technologies in their own creations in a much more flexible
manner. If you feel strongly about supporting privacy-aware applications
(especially after the Cambridge Analytica scandal), and encouraging
communities that aren't motivated by profit, OpenStreetMaps should be
something to consider. There are over 1,000,000 mappers who have
contributed to OSM, and you can become one of those too.</p>
<p>One of the most amazing things about OSM is that whereas mapping the
world is an inherently complex process, it has managed to make it easy
and fun and doable by anybody who knows how to draw a rectangle with
their mouse. Most of the other open-source initiatives have a high
learning curve and lots of technical prerequisites, but OSM is
completely the opposite. Just zoom into your city on
<a href="https://osm.org/">OSM.org</a> and click the <code>Edit</code> button on the top left.
It will give you a short tutorial that lets you draw new roads and
buildings within minutes. The thought that has gone into the
user-friendliness of this online map editor is absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>I'll talk about OSM a bit more in upcoming posts, and share some of the
more interesting technical sides of things.</p>

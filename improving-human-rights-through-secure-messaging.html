<p>Earlier this year, I talked about <a href="../digital-privacy-important-you-think-doesnt-impact-you/article.md">how important digital privacy
is</a>
(even if you don't think it is). I talked about political oppression,
and how raising the awareness of basic digital privacy largely benefits
those who are politically oppressed. Using secure services increases the
amount of infrastructure dedicated towards them and raises the standards
of digital security worldwide. But before we talk about how we make the
first steps, let's remind ourselves why this is so important.</p>
<p><img alt="2018 Freedom in the World index map" src="freedom-in-the-world-index.png"></p>
<p>The map above shows the results of the 2018 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World">Freedom in the World
index</a>, derived
largely from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">Universal Declaration of Human
Rights</a>.
At the time, it was signed without competition by all UN member states.
Green is free, yellow is partly free, and red is not free. As of 2018,
more than half the countries in the world have issues.</p>
<p><img alt="Percentage of countries in the freedom in the world index over
time" src="freedom-index-progress-over-time.png"></p>
<p>There are quite a few ways to slice and dice freedom index data, but the
general trend since the 1970s can be seen in the graph above - showing
the distribution of free countries over time. Generally, since the
1970s, we've improved a bit, but largely stalled in the past 20 years.
More than half the world still seems to have some problems in regard to
political and civil liberties, and a few are getting worse. Of course,
the above data is a gross simplification, so if you're interested in
seeing more detailed and granular metrics I highly urge you to check
other dimensions such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/human-rights">Our World In Data's Human Rights
graphs</a>.</p>
<p>The good news is that we all use the internet, and by using it we shape
how it grows, and that allows us to make an impact on human rights. The
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/what-are-your-digital-rights-explainer/">World Economic
Forum</a>
illustrates the link between digital privacy and human rights in the
quote below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital rights are basically human rights in the internet era. The
rights to online privacy and freedom of expression, for example, are
really extensions of the equal and inalienable rights laid out in the
United Nationâ€™s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a case study, Facebook bi-anually releases a report called the Global
Government Requests report (see the <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/04/global-government-requests-report-7/">2017 Global Government Requests
Report</a>
blog post). In the first half of 2017, it shows that there were roughly
79,000 government requests for data for 115,000 user accounts. That's
more than double what it was three years ago (35,000 user accounts).
Every report sees an increase in the number of requests, easily growing
more than 30% each year. Yikes! That's some serious compounding privacy
interest!</p>
<p>However, there are steps we can take to raise the basic levels of
digital privacy online. By adopting these technologies, we increase the
global average cost per capita of digital mass surveillance -- and
reduce its efficacy as a tool to control and oppress those in need.</p>
<p>Our online activity can largely be grouped into three categories,
<strong>messaging</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, and <strong>web browsing</strong>. By changing a few habits
in our day-to-day online activities, we can make a difference. In this
article, we'll concentrate on messaging.</p>
<p>We send messages all the time - SMSes, through Facebook Messenger,
WhatsApp, Skype, Google Hangouts and so on. If you're the statistically
average user, you have 2 messaging apps, and they're both on the chart
below. The data comes from
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/">Statista</a>,
and I've rehashed it slightly.</p>
<p><img alt="Global monthly active users for different messaging
apps" src="global-messaging-monthly-active-users.png"></p>
<p>(note: due to a formatting error, you will need to multiply the
horizontal axis by 1,000. So Facebook's numbers are over 2.5 billion!)</p>
<p>What you may not know is that big data on the internet is owned by a
handful of companies, governed by a handful of countries. USA's Facebook
and China's TenCent gathers more of your messages than probably
everything else combined. These companies have little to no incentive to
protect your data, actively create digital profiles of you, and are
based in countries that have governments that are more than happy to ask
for it to be disclosed. .</p>
<p>But don't listen to me, listen to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/POL40/4985/2016/en/">Amnesty International's Encryption
and Human Rights
Report</a>
instead. Unless you're using Facebook's WhatsApp (which is the least
bad), Amnesty International thinks you deserve a slap on the wrist.
<strong>Worst of all messaging apps is China-based TenCent's QQ and WeChat,
which scores a 0 out of 100 in protecting human rights</strong>. It has no
encryption specification, does not recognise threats to human rights,
made no commitment to freedom of expression, actively detects and
censors content, and does not refuse backdoor implementations. So, if
you send money through WeChat (yes, WeChat has higher transaction
volumes than PayPal), guess what? It's public! We could go through the
many examples of public data but I'll let you read the publication
yourself and judge.</p>
<p>So what makes Facebook's WhatsApp the least bad? Well, for a start it
has publicly stated there is no encryption backdoor - no built-in
mechanism for sharing your data. It's more transparent and tries to
notify you if your data is being requested, and produces bi-annual
reports that we saw above. But perhaps the most effective secret sauce
-- the gold-standard of digital humans rights protection -- is that it
supports end-to-end encryption. This means that the moment your message
leaves your device, nothing can read it.</p>
<p>WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption isn't it's own invention. Like any
robust cryptography standard, it is based off free and open-source
software. Many years ago, defectors from Twitter started a collaborative
effort called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Whisper_Systems">Open Whisper
Systems</a> and
developed the <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> secure messaging system.
Signal is not owned by any company or country, is open-source, and
primarily funded by the Freedom of the Press foundation. For instance,
if you want to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/help/ng-interactive/2017/mar/17/contact-the-guardian-securely">tip off The
Guardian</a>,
Signal is one of your options.</p>
<p><img alt="Signal logo" src="signal-300x300.jpg"></p>
<p>However despite WhatsApp's best intentions in using the Signal system
under the hood, its nature as a Facebook acquisition, organizational
structure and some of its other technical decisions means that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/06/22/battle-of-the-secure-messaging-apps-how-signal-beats-whatsapp/">WhatsApp
falls short of Signal's encryption
standards</a>.
In short, WhatsApp retains metadata about your contacts and messages,
which may be used to infer information about you (much more than you
might think!). Luckily, the small core team that built the Signal system
also have their own app, which is completely privacy focused. It looks
just like any other messaging app out there, and anyone can use it if
they truly want to get top-notch security and privacy. Here's a
screenshot of it from the official <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal
website</a>. If you have an iPhone or Android, you can
download it from the app store for free. It works on your computer with
a computer app, and also works as a <a href="https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli">Signal command line
app</a> if you're a terminal junkie.</p>
<p><img alt="Signal messenger app screenshot" src="signal-messenger.png"></p>
<p>In fact, the core Signal app is such an ideal state of privacy in the
messaging world that apart from earning a special mention in the Amnesty
International report, it also earned a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-foundation/">50 million USD investment from
the co-founder of WhatsApp</a>.
Brian Acton, the co-founder of WhatsApp, was around when WhatsApp made
the initial jump to use Signal as its system under the hood, and after
he left Facebook and WhatsApp, donated to create the Signal Foundation -
a non profit organisation to protect data privacy, transparency, and
open-source development, which aligns with Acton's personal beliefs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If two people want a private conversation, electronic or not, they
should be allowed to have it. - Brian Acton, WhatsApp co-founder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's still so much to talk about, but let's stop here. I highly
recommend that even if you do not fully understand the technical
background behind encryption or the full extent of the humans rights
impact, to take the first step and <a href="https://signal.org/">install
Signal</a>.</p>
<p>See you on the other side!</p>
<p>P.S. For the more technically inclined, you may instead be interested in
setting up your own XMPP server that supports the OMEMO XEP. OMEMO is an
implementation of the same cryptographic technique pioneered by the
Signal protocol, and XMPP offers decentralised messaging, in contrast to
Signal Messenger, which for all practical purposes is a centralised
system (theoretically, it is possible for somebody to use the protocol
and build in federation support).</p>

<p>Any computer enthusiast will tell you that whereas computers in general
have been getting better over the years, keyboards have been steadily
degrading in their preference for design rather than build quality.
Simply put, all keyboards nowadays (characterised by mushy rubber dome
chicklet keys) are terrible. If all of this sounds like a weird geek
fetish to you, stop reading now. Otherwise, read <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide">this series of
posts</a>
which will give you a good general knowledge of the subject.</p>
<p>I had been debating for a while now whether or not to invest in a proper
mechanical keyboard. Given that I am mostly mobile on a laptop, lugging
around another keyboard would be a pain. But recently I stumbled across
an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">IBM Model M</a> back
from 1991 (there is a birth certificate on its back).</p>
<p><img alt="IBM Model M Keyboard" src="ibm_model_m_keyboard.jpg"></p>
<p>After giving it a thorough cleaning, I have been using this for a month
now and it is a beauty to type on -- I doubt I'll ever go back to using
a regular keyboard again.</p>
<p>A few gotchas for the uninitiated:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's loud. Loud loud loud. Fine for your bedroom, but can be
    annoying in the office (you will bring it into work, won't you?).
    However it'll make everyone aware that you're definitely hard at
    work.</li>
<li>It's big. So big that it won't neatly fit into any bag. You may want
    to consider a "Spacesaver" edition without the numpad.</li>
<li>There is no super (windows) key. Annoying if you rely on it for
    shortcuts, but ultimately a small price to pay for angels tapdancing
    on your fingers.</li>
<li>It's <em>not</em> hard to press. Although the keys are bigger, it's easier
    to type on this than on other keyboards.</li>
<li>It uses a PS/2 cable. You will likely need to buy a PS/2 to USB
    adapter to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those who have had the same dilemma as I did, make the switch. You
won't regret it.</p>

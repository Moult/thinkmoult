<p>This is a wooden, white painted, hollowcore door with a structural opening of
900mm wide and 2100mm high. It has a wooden, white painted 50mm jamb which has a
beveled deep reveal. The door leaf is 800mm wide by 2050mm high.</p>
<p>It has a shiny steel door handle hardware with a doorknob lock, as well as a
barrel bolt above it.</p>
<p>The center of the door has glazing. Above the glazing, there is a rolled up
white fabric blinds, which has a plastic bead string for control, that passes
through a latch screwed into the door. The white fabric blinds are translucent.</p>
<p>The bottom of a door has a raised timber reveal, which is not standard, but
specific to this house. The door leaf has a black rubber air seal screwed to the
bottom.</p>
<p>The door currently only contains hardware on one side, so it is not expected to
be seen from the other side.</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>The colours have been calibrated with Macbethcal but the specularity and
roughness values are guessed.</p>
<p>The white fabric of the blinds are translucent and measured using a lux meter to
check light transmission.</p>

<p><img alt="Preview of the wall sconce with an LG125/860B22 lamp" src="pic/lamp-sconce-lg125-860b22.png"></p>
<p>I have this spherical sconce luminaire in my house. I don't know what product it
is or where it came from, but I measured it. It has a plastic socket and it has
a white coated sphere as a globe / bulb. So yes, technically this model includes
the full luminaire, and that's why I kept "sconce" in the name.</p>
<p>The globe / lamp itself as an LG125/860B22 bulb with a opal polycarbonate
diffuser sphere, with a white plastic shell. It with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>B22 base</li>
<li>High efficiency SMD LED chips inside with a 270 degree beam</li>
<li>6000K</li>
<li>CRI&gt;80</li>
<li>1200 lumens</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no <code>.ies</code> file.</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>The colours have been calibrated with Macbethcal but the specularity and
roughness values are guessed.</p>
<p>Two version of the bulb material are provided - one is when the bulb is off, and
one when the bulb is on. As there is no <code>.ies</code> file, but as the globe emits a
rather omnidirectional white light, it is approximated with a <code>light</code> material,
with the options taken from <code>lampcolor</code>. Depending on which <code>.rad</code> file you
include, you can either turn the bulb on or off.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This Radiance model follows the <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/proposed-radiance-filesystem-hierarchy-standard.html">Radiance Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard</a>. As
such, please run <code>make lib</code> to build the Radiance mesh file. Once done, you can
use this in your scene by:</p>

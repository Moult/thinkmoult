<p>As some might remember, I was involved in a Sydney revue last year by
the university of Sydney architecture faculty as the musical director.
It was called Game of Homes (a shameless pun on the Game of Thrones
series). Not only was I involved with music, it also gave me the
wonderful opportunity to create a 3D animation for its opening sequence
based on the original (and very well done) Game of Thrones sequence. You
can view the animation sequence and corresponding revue poster in <a href="../game-of-homes-opening-sequence-animation/article.md" title="Sydney revue game of Homes 2012">this
post</a>.</p>
<p>As this is an annual event, I'm happy to say that I'm again involved in
it this year (as music again) and would like to present <strong>Floorless</strong>, a
spaghetti western with a particularly complex pun for a title. It's a
joke on both the film Lawless, and on Flawless with an architectural
twist. Get it? Nope? That's alright. Me neither.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can tell that this is a quality Sydney revue because it has
a quality poster. This means that if you're in Sydney on the 5th, 6th or
7th of September, you should buy a cheap ticket and watch it.</p>

<p>It contains all the right ingredients for a successful western. These
include bandits, sherrifs, the town stranger, the town drunk, the
fastest shot in the West (which may sometime be the town drunk), the
banjo brandishing hillbilly, the lonely harmonica player, a whip*, the
mayor, Mexicans, the fine lass, and a Final standoff with capital F.</p>
<p>Also, there used to be an official revue website somewhere but as I
can't find it I assume that someone forgot to renew the domain and the
site no longer exists.</p>
<p>Cheers, and see you at the event!</p>
<ul>
<li>the whip may or may not be used at the actual event, and audience
    are recommended to not buy tickets for the front row.</li>

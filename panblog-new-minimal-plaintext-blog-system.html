<p>I'd like to introduce Panblog, a brand new blog system written for those who
think the web got a little bit out of hand. Here's the introduction from the
<code>README.md</code> file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Panblog is a minimalist blog system. You write articles in Markdown with
metadata in YAML, and Pandoc converts your articles to HTML. The entire
system of Panblog is a 72 line Makefile and 14 line lua filter, excluding
HTML and Atom feed templates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no web interface, no dynamic scripting language being executed on each
server call. Just your filesystem, your favourite text editor, and a Makefile
that generates static HTML for you to host. In fact, this blog you're reading
right now is running on Panblog.</p>
<p>You can get Panblog from this <a href="http://git.sevenstrokes.net/?p=panblog.git;a=summary">git
repository</a> or this
<a href="https://gitlab.com/dionmoult/panblog">Gitlab mirror</a>.</p>
<h2>Panblog features</h2>
<p>Here's the comprehensive list of features that Panblog has:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open-source and free.</li>
<li>Extremely lightweight. In fact, it's only 86 lines of code!</li>
<li>Super-duper fast. Your generated blog is static HTML. No server language required.</li>
<li>Plaintext post editing in Markdown.</li>
<li>Supports showing a "Latest 10 posts" or similar on your homepage.</li>
<li>Supports an archived list of all articles.</li>
<li>Supports generation of Atom feeds.</li>
<li>Custom HTML templates for fancy webdesigns.</li>
<li>Supports post comments using the fediverse.</li>
<li>Awesome SEO optimisation with semantic HTML, meta tags and description</li>
</ol>
<p>Panblog allows you to use your favourite editor like <code>vim</code>. Do you want
versioned posts, editing from any computer, secure logins, and multiple author
access? No worries! Use <code>git</code>! Do you want search functionality? Cool,
Panblog's default template comes with DuckDuckGo search. Hate Markdown? Sure,
write in LaTeX, textile, rst, docx, or even html directly. Panblog supports 
whatever <code>pandoc</code> does, which is a lot.</p>
<h2>Panblog demo</h2>
<p>Here's a screenshot of me writing this post in Panblog! I'm using <code>vim</code>, if
that matters.</p>
<p><img alt="Panblog in action!" src="panblog-screenshot.png"></p>
<p>Panblog is so small that you can just open up the <code>Makefile</code> and read what it
does. But for the initiatively challenged, here's a summary.</p>
<pre><code>$ vim articles/my-article/article.md
$ vim articles/my-article/metadata.yaml
$ make all
</code></pre>
<p>This'll convert your article to <code>weblog/my-article.html</code>. If you have any links like <code>[another article](../another-article/article.md)</code> it'll automagically make the links work in HTML.</p>
<p>You can also run some other commands like:</p>
<pre><code>$ make articles # Regenerate all article HTML
$ make article name=my-article # Regenerate a single article
$ make archive # Update your article archive page
$ make index # Update your home page with 10 latest posts
$ make feed # Update your Atom feed
</code></pre>
<p>Oh, and you can also migrate from Wordpress to Panblog using this <a href="https://gitlab.com/dionmoult/panblog/snippets/1770393">Wordpress to
Panblog migration
script</a>. No guarantees
it'll work with your Wordpress setup, though, but it may help.</p>
<h2>Does it have bugs?</h2>
<p>Yes. I'm not a shell guru, and it's heavily underengineered. Pull requests are welcome.</p>
<h2>Can panblog do XYZ?</h2>
<p>If you're the type of person who would use Panblog, you're the type of person
who is able to edit 100 lines of code and make it do what you want.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://git.sevenstrokes.net/?p=thinkmoult.git;a=summary">thinkMoult blog
source</a> shows some
fancy additions, such as a 42 line addition to generate a gopher website.</p>

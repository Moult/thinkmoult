<p>If you have an annual income of 32,400 USD or more per year, you belong to an
exclusive club of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/050615/are-you-top-one-percent-world.asp">the richest 1% in the
world</a>.
This might sound absurd to those new to the concept of global income inequality,
but is perhaps a bit more palatable when we realise that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty">a third of the world
lives on 10 dollars a day</a> (that's
3,650 USD a year).</p>
<p>A common response to hearing this is that it can be explained through cheaper
goods in poor countries, exchange rates, or that poor people can produce a lot
of their goods and don't need as much currency. However, it is possible to
account for purchasing power parity and the economic value of self-produced
goods. Fact check after fact check confirms this - if you are reading this
article from a first-world country, you are likely in the 1%. If you are still
incredulous that people can survive on so little money, the answer is that
<em>they don't</em>. The global poor experience malnutrition, limited water, little or
no electricity, lack  healthcare, and end up <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">dying up to 30 years
earlier than the rich</a> as a result.</p>
<p><img alt="The poor die up to 30 years earlier than the rich" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/ourworldindata_no-100-charts-banner-life-expectancy-vs-gdp-scatter.png"></p>
<p>What responsibilities should the 1% have? We know that there are global issues
facing the 99% less fortunate. However, as we surround ourselves with those
equally rich or richer than us, we feel overwhelmingly average.</p>
<p>As mere individuals, the scale and complexity of these problems are hard to
comprehend. Often, we choose to simply ignore them, chasing the smaller
personal goals we have set in our individual rat races, like buying a house or
raising kids. We hope that there is someone else, someone smarter, richer, and
more influential, who will solve the problems for us. Is there a practical way
to both live our lives and do good in the world?</p>
<p>In my search for answers, I have come across concepts which I have distilled
into my own practical solution described in this article. I hope it may help
spark debate, and for others to improve on what I have discovered so far.</p>
<h2>Global problems: which should we address?</h2>
<p>Global poverty, climate change, the superbug, and AI misuse are a small sample
of the biggest issues facing humanity. But there's not much use in solving
global poverty if the Earth stops being able to sustain life. In the long-term,
in addition to tackling human-specific problems, there is a more fundamental
issue that all other initiatives need to comply with.</p>
<p>Simply put, the Earth produces a fixed amount of resources annually that we can
work with, called <em>biocapacity</em>. In the same way that overdrawing funds from
the bank results in a financial crisis, we need to ensure that we don't
overdraw the Earth's capacity to sustain life while solving problems. To do this, we need to determine our environmental budget.</p>
<p>In Sydney, Australia, I am surrounded by convenience. I have
electricity, water, and waste management. I am surrounded by shops, restaurants,
roads, parks, and schools. I am also surrounded by lots of other people, each
enjoying the same convenience as me. What I <em>don't see</em> is the infrastructure
required to provide this convenience, and which fraction of that infrastructure
is solely dedicated towards my lifestyle.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://data.footprintnetwork.org/">Global Footprint Network</a> figures that
the average person in Australia requires 6.6 global hectares of productive
resources (in 2016). The unit of a global hectare is a little difficult to
explain, but I can loosely approximate it as a regular hectare. This means that
somewhere out there, there are 9-10 FIFA football fields of infrastructure,
producing the water, food, clothes, construction material for my house,
electronics for my computer, and so on, dedicated <em>just for me</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="The world map of ecological footprint per capita in gha (2016), graphic from footprintnetwork.org" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/ecological-footprint-per-capita-in-gha.png"></p>
<p>The good news is that Australia is a big country. Australia as a country can
naturally regenerate 12.3 global hectares worth of resources per person per
year. This means that Australia can let all of its residents happily live at
this level of consumption, and each person in Australia has 5.7gha of surplus
left to share with the kangaroos, koalas, and thousands of other species that
also live in Australia. It sounds a little selfish to take half the area just
for humans, but it's certainly better than nothing.</p>
<p>However, not every country is as large or lucky as Australia, and not every
country is as sparsely populated as Australia. Globally, we overdraw the Earth's
resources, with humans consuming the equivalent to 1.7 Earths biocapacity.
Earth may currently have enough stock to allow for this, but not all stock is
equal, and efforts required to tap into this stock are at the expense of others
species.</p>
<p>The extrapolation of this form of excessive consumption is mass extinction.
Ethically, it's probably a good idea to avoid this. Unfortunately, the
extinction process has already started.
<a href="http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/biodiversity/biodiversity/">WWF</a> estimates
extinction rates that are 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than the background
extinction rate (i.e. the rate if humans weren't around).</p>
<p>Regardless of any large issue we choose to tackle, our strategy needs to also be
such that <em>our ecological footprint does not exceed the biocapacity available</em>. Can we balance our ecological budget and do good at the same time?</p>
<h2>Net-positive living is the solution to biocapacity overdrafting</h2>
<p>Architects are no strangers to minimising ecological footprint, otherwise known
as sustainable design. When architects design buildings, the good ones usually
consider strategies to minimise unnecessary resources, be it electricity, water,
or construction material. Some architects go further and try to design buildings
that <em>produce</em> ecological resources. This is a concept called net-positive, or
regenerative architecture.</p>
<p>Net-positive buildings are designed as a species within an ecosystem. These
buildings, like all species, consume resources, but most importantly, <em>produce</em>
resources that benefit other species. This is similar to how biological species
work in natural ecosystems. These relationships are important, as the more
interdependent species are, the more resilient an ecosystem is against the risk
of collapse.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have managed to design net-positive buildings with a
ledger of their biological impacts over their lifespan. Where they take from the
environment, a strategy is in place to give back more than they took. There are
buildings that <a href="https://ecodatacenter.uk/climate-positive/">sequester more carbon than they
output</a>, or <a href="https://vancouverconvention.cdn.prismic.io/vancouverconvention%2F799cc6be-2b09-403b-b1bf-f5424103a1c6_vancouver+convention+centre_sustainability+fact+sheet.pdf">improve water
quality</a>,
or <a href="https://zaytunafarm.com/about-us/">improve soil fertility</a>, or <a href="https://www.earthshipglobal.com/some-of-our-previous-projects">reduce
ecological
dead-ends</a>, or
<a href="https://regenesisgroup.com/project/the-willow-school/">provide habitat</a>. <em>So
if we can design buildings to be net-positive,
can we design our lifestyles to be net-positive too?</em></p>
<p>In the case of humans, we consume a lot. Minimising our consumption (and
limiting population growth) are valid and extremely effective strategies.
However, in this article I want to talk about what we <em>produce</em>, which is a
trickier problem. Things we produce have an abnormally large negative
contribution to the ecosystem. As an example, our production of plastic is a
bit of an ecological dead-end, as it doesn't create useful nutrients that new
life can spring from. In fact, our plastic tends to almost universally harm
other species.</p>
<p>As you're probably aware, it is quite hard to avoid plastic. Indeed, plastic is
just one of many problems that are built into our lifestyles and urban
infrastructure. The very act of commuting to work produces air pollution and
burns carbon. Eating a meal contributes towards unethical farming practices and
drinking water adds just that bit more to the unsustainable extraction of
freshwater.</p>
<p>There are "extreme" lifestyle changes that have been demonstrated to mitigate
these issues. Such examples are <a href="http://www.learnpermaculture.com/">urban
permaculture</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism">veganism</a>, the <a href="https://zerowastehome.com/2017/01/24/tedx-talk-zero-waste-is-not-recycling-more-but-less/">zero-waste
movement</a>, and <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/children.html">not having children</a>.
They require a level of discipline and dedication that may be simply unlikely
for lots of people. It also requires a lot of research about things we aren't
trained in or access to things we don't have. For instance, if I live in a 1
bedroom apartment with no garden, my options for planting trees to offset my
carbon footprint are limited. Or perhaps we want to help with the issue of
water scarcity, but we have no idea what we can even do.</p>
<p>To start with, I've identified the following major categories of human
consumption and production. There are probably more, but it's a start:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon footprint</li>
<li>Ethical food consumption</li>
<li>Sustainable water usage</li>
<li>Biodiversity and loss of ecosystems</li>
<li>Waste management</li>
<li>Air pollution and quality</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not an expert on any of these topics. They're all big issues, but try as I might to avoid plastic, take the train, or buy free-range eggs, what impact can I really have?</p>
<p>What if we could pay others who are trained and actively involved to solve the
problems for us? It might sound like a cop-out, but if the alternative is doing
nothing, what could we achieve with purely our wallets? How do we find these
people? How do we guarantee that they can make a difference?   <em>If we
make <strong>32,400</strong> USD a year as the richest <strong>1%</strong> of the world, is <strong>1,620</strong> dollars a year,
<strong>135</strong> dollars a month, or <strong>5%</strong> of our salary enough to live a net-positive life?</em></p>
<p>It might sound crazy, but it might just be possible. Let me explain how.</p>
<h2>Effective altruism allows specialists to do what they do best</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism">Effective
altruism</a>
is the concept that not all altruistic efforts are equal. The example given by
Peter Singer in his TED talk is that if you were interested in helping blind
people, one option is to sponsor a guide dog. The total cost of training a
guide dog and its client comes out to above 40,000USD. However, there are blind
people in developing countries which can have treatments that only amount to
25USD per treatment, thanks to the preventability of the affliction, and the
magic of exchange rates. Therefore, a utilitarian approach would suggest that a
charity dealing with the latter would be 1,000 times more cost-effective than
raising guide dogs.</p>
<p>As a stellar example, the <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a>
recommended by <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a> has
a return of <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/impact-calculator">protecting 90 people from malaria for 3-4 years for every 100USD
donated</a>. If you
donated 5% of your 32,400USD yearly income, you would protect 1,450 people from malaria
every year. In contrast, if you quit your job and became a doctor, you would
only <a href="https://80000hours.org/2012/09/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save-part-3-replacement-84/">save about 20 lives over a 43-year
career</a>.
This doesn't mean that doctors aren't good to the world, on the contrary:
doctors are what makes health improvement even possible. It also doesn't mean
that doctors should quit their jobs: that would be the wrong conclusion. What
it does demonstrate is that a focused financial redirection can have a large
impact, even if you aren't employed in the industry.</p>
<p>By identifying effective initiatives that others are taking to solve global problems, can we support them financially to "offset" the negative aspects of our own lives? To answer this, we will need three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>An account of our own ecological footprint</li>
<li>An initiative which makes the world a better place with measurable impacts</li>
<li>A dollar value to offset our actions</li>
</ol>
<p>I will give examples from my own life below, using the categories of human consumption and production identified above.</p>
<h2>Example ecological footprint calculations</h2>
<h3>Carbon footprint</h3>
<p>The concept of a carbon footprint has been heavily researched. This makes it
easy to calculate my personal carbon footprint, easy to identify initiatives
that help store carbon, and easy to place a dollar value.</p>
<p>We tend to emit carbon directly through our transport, and indirectly through
our lifestyles. These are easily calculated using online carbon calculators
such as this one from <a href="https://climatecare.org/calculator/">ClimateCare.org</a>
and this one from
<a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">CarbonFootprint.com</a>.</p>
<p>Carbon from electricity usage is included in my electricity bill. I actually
pay more for green energy (note: renewables still have a carbon footprint, just
less so!), but in the figures below I have pretended that I do not purchase
green energy.</p>
<p>Car travel can be derived by looking at my car maintenance logbook and the
odometer readings. Based on data from 43 vehicles, 1,329 fuel-ups and 351,879
miles of driving, the <a href="http://www.fuelly.com/car/honda/jazz/2006">2006 Honda Jazz gets a combined average MPG of
33.63</a> with a 0.50 MPG margin of
error. Feel free to look up your car.</p>
<p>Train and bus travel is easy to calculate by measuring a map. You can do this
for free using Google Maps online, although if you are capable I would
encourage doing this exercise with open-source software such as
<a href="https://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMaps</a>.</p>
<p>Here are my personal results for the first six months of 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jan 2019</strong>: 7.59 tCO2eq<ul>
<li>236kWh of electricity: 0.21 tCO2eq</li>
<li>730km of car travel: 0.13 tCO2eq</li>
<li>716km of train travel: 0.03 tCO2eq</li>
<li>3km of bus travel: negligible</li>
<li>1500-2000USD of secondary emissions: 7.21 tCO2eq</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Feb 2019</strong>: 8.74 tCO2eq<ul>
<li>207kWh of electricity: 0.18 tCO2eq</li>
<li>659km of car travel: 0.12 tCO2eq</li>
<li>845km of train travel: 0.04 tCO2eq</li>
<li>15km of bus travel: negligible</li>
<li>1500-2000USD of secondary emissions: 8.40 tCO2eq</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>March 2019</strong>: 7.43 tCO2eq<ul>
<li>229kWh of electricity: 0.20 tCO2eq</li>
<li>730km of car travel: 0.13 tCO2eq</li>
<li>803km of train travel: 0.04 tCO2eq</li>
<li>1500-2000USD of secondary emissions: 7.06 tCO2eq</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>April 2019</strong>: 9.14 tCO2eq<ul>
<li>Flight from Sydney (SYD) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) via Singapore (SIN) (return): 1.85 tCO2eq</li>
<li>222kWh of electricity: 0.19 tCO2eq</li>
<li>706km of car travel: 0.13 tCO2eq</li>
<li>281km of train travel: 0.01 tCO2eq</li>
<li>5km of bus travel: negligible</li>
<li>1500-2000USD of secondary emissions: 6.96 tCO2eq</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>May 2019</strong>: 9.62 tCO2eq<ul>
<li>(Forecasted) 229kWh of electricity: 0.20 tCO2eq</li>
<li>730km of car travel: 0.13 tCO2eq</li>
<li>779km of train travel: 0.03 tCO2eq</li>
<li>1500-2000USD of secondary emissions: 9.26 tCO2eq</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>June 2019</strong>: 7.8 tCO2eq<ul>
<li>(Forecasted) 222kWh of electricity: 0.19 tCO2eq</li>
<li>706km of car travel: 0.13 tCO2eq</li>
<li>834km of train travel: 0.04 tCO2eq</li>
<li>1500-2000USD of secondary emissions: 7.44 tCO2eq</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives an average of ~8.4 tonnes of CO2 per month. I personally find it
interesting how much higher secondary emissions are compared to primary
emissions.</p>
<p>Charity evaluators have heavily researched carbon initiatives. One of the most
cost-effective charities in the field is the <a href="https://www.coolearth.org/">Cool
Earth</a> initiative. If the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/report/cool-earth/#3-overall-evaluation">Cool Earth charity is
able to reduce CO2 emissions by 0.38 USD per
tCO2eq</a>,
it will cost me only 39USD per year (or 3 dollars 20 cents per month) to become
net-zero in terms of carbon. Even if I conservatively took the upper bound of
the research estimate at 0.71 USD per tCO2eq, it only comes out to be roughly
6USD a month. This is very affordable.</p>
<p>I'm in Australia, so if I donate 20AUD a month (the cost of a dinner at a nice
restaurant), this is equivalent to reducing all my CO2 emissions 2-4 times. This
should be enough to cover any inaccuracies in my estimations, and still have an
additional net-positive impact.</p>
<p>For interested readers, there is some <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RnmZ62kuuC8XzeTBq/why-we-have-over-rated-cool-earth">criticism of Cool
Earth</a>,
as well as suggestions to look at other approaches such as initiatives around
contraception.</p>
<p><strong>Result: ~14USD per month</strong></p>
<h3>Ethical food consumption</h3>
<p>Our food systems have an animal cruelty problem. We've covered the carbon
aspect of our eating, and later we'll cover the water use and loss of
biodiversity, but we need to do something about our actual treatment of
animals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm">average Australian in 2017 eats 8.6kg of sheep, 21.1kg of beef, 21.3kg of
pork, and 44kg of poultry every
year</a>. Let's round that
up to 100kg of meat carcass per year. Note that our actual consumption weight
would be slightly less, as carcass includes disposable parts such as bones,
food prep, and spoilage.</p>
<p>Charities that deal with animal cruelty are researched to a lesser quality
compared to human charities or environmental charities. Simply put, it's harder
to measure the quality of life changes with farming practices, and even harder
to confidently attribute these changes to the actions of a charity.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>,
the animal-focused equivalent of GiveWell mentioned above recommends the <a href="https://albertschweitzerfoundation.org/">Albert
Schweitzer Foundation</a>. Here's the
<a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/albert-schweitzer-foundation/#overview">claim from the
website</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an average $1,000 donation, ASF would spend about $530 on corporate
outreach campaigns. They would spend about $270 on individual outreach, $160
on legal advocacy, and $40 on media outreach. Our rough estimate is that
these activities combined would spare -110,000 to 220,000 animals from life
in industrial agriculture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The negative values are because it is quite hard to actually guarantee that the
charity itself is doing good instead of harm. The detailed review additionally
warns that <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/our-use-of-cost-effectiveness-estimates/#4.1">these cost-effectiveness estimates should not be taken as an
overall opinion of the
charity</a>,
as they are very broad approximations. In fact, they encourage a low degree of
confidence in these numbers. If you wanted to truly select an animal cruelty
charity to support, it is recommended to read the full qualitative analysis. If
you did want to focus on quantitative analysis, there are <a href="http://ethical.diet/">ethical food
calculators</a> online.</p>
<p>That said, using the numbers as a ballpark is better than nothing. If we
simplistically take the midpoint of the 90% Subjective Confidence Interval, it
results in about 55 animals spared per dollar. It doesn't specify exactly what
type of animal it is (but the report suggests that it is <em>not</em> fish), so we can
be conservative and imagine that they are the smallest common animal out there:
chickens.</p>
<p>If we further continued our overestimated ballpark that we ate 100kg of meat
per year, this is equivalent to 800 <a href="https://www.chicken.org.au/chicken-cuts/">125g
drumsticks</a>, or affecting the lives
of 400 chickens. Obviously, we eat more parts of a chicken than just the
drumsticks, and we also eat other types of meat, but chicken
drumsticks seem to be the lightest quantum of meat we can use to conservatively
maximise our animal count. Even with this inflated number of animals, it still
only costs 8USD a year to offset our actions. We could happily multiply that by
a factor of 10 as a penalty for the ultra rough calculations we're doing, and
the resultant of 80USD per year is still within our budget.</p>
<p><strong>Result: ~7USD per month</strong></p>
<h3>Sustainable water usage</h3>
<p>Water, like carbon, is relatively easy to calculate. Apart from looking at your
water bill which has your direct water consumption, there are some indirect
water usages through our lifestyles, such as eating meat. I found a water
calculator from
<a href="https://waterfootprint.org/en/resources/interactive-tools/personal-water-footprint-calculator/">WaterFootprint.org</a>
and <a href="https://www.watercalculator.org/">WaterCalculator.org</a>.</p>
<p>My water usage is not metered separately from my landlord, so my water bill is
not an accurate representation of my direct consumption. However, I have
conservatively outlined the following lavish lifestyle:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x10 minute showers per day with a standard showerhead</li>
<li>1.5 laundry loads per week</li>
<li>1x10 minute dishwashing session</li>
<li>1x5 minute garden watering per week</li>
<li>No car washing</li>
</ul>
<p>This comes out to 12kL per month. To put this into perspective, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/emerg/files/UNHCR_handbook.pdf">10 litres a
day</a> is seen as a
threshold where people become water refugees. The <a href="https://spherestandards.org/handbook/editions/">Sphere Handbook (page
107)</a> says that the basic water
requirements to be used for planning refugee camps ranges from 7.5-15 litres
per day. Therefore, my water consumption can serve 26 to 53 refugees.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/12/indian-villages-lie-empty-as-drought-forces-thousands-to-flee">Guardian article about the drought in Indian
villages</a>
describes residents who are too poor to buy water due to water scarcity. Those
who can afford water need to pay 4USD per 1,000 litres. If 4USD per person
sounds affordable to prevent a water refugee crisis, it means that we can
certainly make a big impact.</p>
<p>But let's take a look at our indirect water consumption. Here's a conservative
estimate of what I eat:</p>
<ul>
<li>125g of meat per meal</li>
<li>4.5kg of cereal products per week</li>
<li>2kg of meat per week</li>
<li>2kg of dairy per week</li>
<li>8 eggs per week</li>
<li>1kg of vegetables per week</li>
<li>1kg of fruits per week</li>
<li>1kg of starchy roots per week</li>
<li>1 cup of coffee per day</li>
</ul>
<p>This indirect water use totals 117kL per month. This is 10 times more than my
direct water consumption and is largely "invisible" to me. The largest culprit
is meat-eating, resulting in 54% of my water, followed by cereal products with
25%.</p>
<p>Both my direct and indirect water usage combined comes out to 129kL per month.</p>
<p>When it comes to addressing this 129kL per month, it's not about extracting
more water for other people who don't have access to water. Humans are already
quite capable of water extraction -- the problem is in <em>sustainable</em> water
extraction. Instead, we should ensure that the <a href="https://www.wri.org/publication/natural-infrastructure">world's natural
infrastructure</a> remains
operational to produce freshwater. Examples of natural infrastructure are
our rivers, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Living in Sydney, the water I produce is first processed through treatment
plants before being discharged into the ocean. This helps ensure that the
waterways stay clean. Unfortunately, not all countries are as lucky as Sydney,
and some discharge polluted water directly into the ocean.</p>
<p>The water I consume directly, however, comes primarily from the Warragamba Dam,
which mostly acts as a reservoir, instead of a hydroelectric dam. Dams have
large issues with damaging natural systems, and it would do a large amount of
good to replace dams worldwide, or let <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140322-colorado-river-delta-pulse-flow-morelos-dam-minute-319-water/">dams release pulses of
water</a>.
However, initiatives that target dams and rivers are few and difficult to pin
down evidence of efficiency.</p>
<p>Most of my water consumption is indirect and is captured through agricultural
practices. Australian agriculture is affected by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2018/apr/05/murray-darling-when-the-river-runs-dry">mismanagement of the
Murray-Darling
basin</a>,
where a catchment larger than Egypt has been slowly deteriorating. Wrapped up
in political events, the bottom line shows that despite efforts, the rivers are
dying and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/24/murray-darling-fish-kill-extreme-weather-and-low-river-flow-led-to-drop-in-oxygen-levels">up to a million fish are
dead</a>.
Yet again, it is hard to find any targeted initiative that has evidence of
efficiency.</p>
<p>The remaining infrastructure to consider is wetlands. Wetlands serve many
functions, only one of which is water purification. An arbitrarily discovered
EPA study suggests one particular <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/free_water_surface_wetlands.pdf">wetland processes 378.5kL per day for a
1.3ha site</a>.
This provides a ballpark figure of processing 291kL per day per hectare.
Therefore, I would need to support 1 hectare of wetlands for 6 days to cover my
yearly water usage of 1548kL.</p>
<p>Wetlands are protected globally through the <a href="https://www.ramsar.org/">Ramsar
Convention</a>. Ramsar identifies wetlands of importance,
and participating countries ban harmful industry actions in the area and
conservation groups are set up to protect and monitor it. One particularly
large Ramsar site nearby is the <a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/water/wetlands/internationally-significant-wetlands/hunter-estuary-wetlands">Hunter Estuary
Wetlands</a>. It meets 3 out of the <a href="https://www.ramsar.org/sites/default/files/documents/library/ramsarsites_criteria_eng.pdf">9 Ramsar criteria</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/287">Hunter estuary wetlands have a total area of
3,388ha</a> and incurs <a href="https://control.visionscape.com.au/SiteFiles/wetlandsorgau/Annual_Report_Print_Ready.pdf">yearly expenses (2013)
of
320,000AUD</a>.
Given that they are <a href="https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/5373607/hunter-wetlands-centre-seeking-support-amid-financial-struggle/">financially
struggling</a>,
it suggests that they have cut costs since and also that the marginal utility
gain from additional donations would be higher. However, with this area and
yearly expense, it suggests it costs on average 94AUD to maintain each hectare
for a year.</p>
<p>Given that I only need to maintain a hectare for 6 days to process my volume of
water, it only costs me 1.6AUD per year. Of course, this is an extremely crude
calculation with numerous assumptions (e.g. same water processing rate as EPA
benchmark, or than the full area of wetlands is protected or functioning
equally, or that there is a linear relationship with business expenses and
wetland function). As a result, I'd be happy to be wrong by a factor of 100,
and decide that I should dedicate 160AUD per year, or 108USD.</p>
<p><strong>Result: ~9USD per month</strong></p>
<h3>Biodiversity and loss of ecosystems</h3>
<p>It is difficult to determine exactly how much biodiversity is lost per person.
Clearly, the footprint of my house excludes all wildlife but the urban flora
and fauna. However, there are many indirect losses, such as from the farmland
required to produce our food.</p>
<p>An easier approach is to look at our total ecological footprint. Earlier in
this article, I stated that the average Australian had 6.6 global hectares of
infrastructure per capita. This is one of the highest in the world. If we
loosely approximate these to be regular hectares, I would need to somehow
protect at least 6.6 hectares of ecosystem out there.</p>
<p>These hectares of ecosystems aren't just limited to Australian ecology. Thanks
to global trade, they cross many typologies, such
as forests, grasslands, deserts, mountains, and marine environments. As such, I
turned to the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/">WWF</a>, which has initiatives
targeting many parts of the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4770">WWF seems to dedicate a large portion of its funds to program
expenses</a>,
despite a 750,000USD salary for its CEO. Its latest yearly expenses were 247
million dollars. But what exactly did it achieve with such spending?</p>
<p>To answer this, I turned to the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/habitats">WWF habitats
page</a>, which talks about their
initiatives in different ecosystems. Although independent analysis rather than
claims from the WWF itself would be preferred, it's a starting point.</p>
<p>On the page on wetlands, they make this claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About 75% of the sites added to the [Ramsar] list since 1999 were included as a
result of WWF’s work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Downloading the <a href="https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris-search/">Ramsar database</a> allows
us to filter sites added in the 2000 or later, of which there are 1,359 sites.
75% of this is 1019 sites. If we sort it in terms of site area and take the
middle 1,019 sites, we estimate that the WWF has protected a total of
17,546,560ha of wetland. This is about 10% of the total added area of all sites
(176,141,282ha), so clearly there are some large outliers in the top 12.5%,
which suggests that this number is an underestimate.</p>
<p>For marine environments, the <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/oceans/solutions/protection/protected_areas/">Marine Protected
Areas</a>
is the equivalent of the Ramsar sites. Its main proponent is the <a href="https://marine-conservation.org/">Marine
Conservation Institute</a>, but WWF does play a
role and has helped add MPAs to the map since the inception near the year 2000.
However, I have not been able to find such a bold claim similar to the Ramsar
statement of adding 75% of new sites.</p>
<p>The MPA aims to cover 30% of the ocean, but <a href="http://mpatlas.org/">currently only covers
4.8%</a>. However, the ocean is mindbogglingly large, with an
area of 36,100,000,000ha, so this 4.8% comes out to about 1,732,800,000ha.
Conservatively if WWF's contribution was 1% of this area, the WWF protects
17,328,000ha.</p>
<p>For forests, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/protecting-the-amazon-for-life">WWF started the ARPA project in
2002</a>. It
is the world's largest conservation project targeting the Brazilian Amazon region.
By 2017, it has protected <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/arpa-for-life-amazon-region-protected-area-phase-iii-report-2017">58,274,784ha</a>. Admittedly,
it was also thanks to the help of other organisations, even if WWF did start the
initiative and make large contributions. There were four main contributors: the
Government of Brazil, WWF, the Linden Trust for Conservation, and the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation, but let's say the WWF contributed merely 10%, meaning
that the WWF had protected 5,827,478ha.</p>
<p>Just through these three large initiatives alone, over 19 years (with each year spending 247 million dollars), the WWF has a
cost effectiveness of 115USD per hectare protected per year. For the average
Australian ecological footprint of 6.6ha (loosely approximated from global
hectares), it costs just 64USD per month to offset my loss in biodiversity.</p>
<p>Given that there are other unaccounted initiatives that target the polar
regions, desertification, mountains, grasslands, and indirect protection that
surely exists from WWF's work, it would be a reasonable conclusion to say that a
monthly 64USD (90AUD) is enough to both offset and be net-positive.</p>
<p><strong>Result: ~64USD per month</strong></p>
<h3>Waste management</h3>
<p>The issue with waste is that they are usually ecological dead ends. Waste that
isn't composted, or recycled turns into landfill that very little new life can
spring from.</p>
<p>Measuring my direct waste was easy. I weighed my unrecycled trash every time I
threw it out. I end up throwing out about 52kg of waste per year. Clearly, I
run a very lean lifestyle compared to the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/waste/municipal-waste.htm">average per capita municipal waste
of 560kg</a>. However, it is very
hard to measure my indirect waste, especially as the waste industry can be
quite opaque. The Bureau of Statistics suggests <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4655.0">Australians produce 2,215kg of
waste per capita per year</a>.</p>
<p>The solution to the waste problem, apart from consuming less, is to change our
manufacturing methods to consider the entire lifecycle of the product. There is
a concept known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle-to-cradle_design">Cradle-to-Cradle</a>,
where products are designed to be waste free, as part of a natural cycle of
nutrients. If humans produced products this way, our waste wouldn't be waste.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.c2ccertified.org/">Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation
Institute</a> was started by the creators of the
cradle to cradle movement, and offer product certification and resources to
allow manufacturers to change their ways.</p>
<p>This is a relatively new initiative, but they do make some claims on their <a href="https://www.c2ccertified.org/">donation page</a>, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shaw Industries makes 80% of its 4.5 Billion in sales with Cradle to Cradle Certified™ products.
Aveda was the first beauty company to manufacture its products with 100% wind power in its manufacturing facility in Minnesota.
IceStone has moved, since 2003, 10 million pounds of glass out of the waste stream as part of their product  design and manufacturing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's consider the first claim, as <a href="https://shawfloors.com/shaw-sustainability/shaw-sustainability-report-2017">Shaw Industries</a> is one of the largest carpet manufacturers out there. Shaw Industries has an incredible <a href="https://shawinc.com/Newsroom#Sustainability-Reports">sustainability track record</a>, and have produced Cradle to Cradle products since 2010, which is when the Cradle to Cradle Institute started. In 2010, ~50% of their sales were in Cradle to Cradle products, and in 2019, they are at ~90%. This increase of 40% of sales across 9 years represents ~10 billion dollars in sales. If the average sale of a product was at a pricey 100USD per square metre and each square metre weighed ~2kg, this equates to 202,400,000kg of Cradle to Cradle products. If the average <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&amp;ein=271832830">yearly expenses of the institute</a> are 2,312,135USD, this results in a cost effectiveness of 10 cents per kilogram.</p>
<p>To cover the average Australian waste of 2,215kg, it results in 221USD per
year, or 19USD per month. This is likely enough to be net-positive, as we
have assumed that no waste is already diverted from landfill, and only
considered one of the claims - they have certainly made strides elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Result: ~19USD per month</strong></p>
<h3>Air pollution and quality</h3>
<p>Air pollution is a tricky one. Although <a href="https://breathelife2030.org/city-data-page/?city=49">Sydney's air quality is 20% below the safe level of PM2.5 annual exposure</a> (i.e. it's very clean), the atmosphere is the dumping ground for a lot of waste so it is hard to attribute air pollution to a particular person. If we merely took that figure at face value, it would suggest that Australia is already "net-positive" in terms of air quality (at least when compared to the WHO baseline). It is also hard to find initiatives that have published measurable results in reducing air pollution.</p>
<p>Air pollution is primarily due to fuel burning. Initiatives that help most
would be to do with switching to greener fuel sources: for our power stations,
 transport, and cooking. In fact, <a href="https://www.energyaustralia.com.au/home/bills-and-accounts/go-neutral">EnergyAustralia offers 100% green energy for no cost to consumers</a>. So switching to that would be extremely cost effective: as it would cost nothing!</p>
<p>The type of fuel that is burned has a strong correlation with income, as
studied by the WHO. Poor people have to rely on unhealthy fuel sources which
create health problems. The <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/43421">WHO estimates 3 billion people who have to burn
wood, dung, and coal inside their
homes</a>. The more we can raise
people out of poverty, the sooner they can naturally make the switch to better
infrastructure. As an example, the WHO states that the pollution in a hut with
open fire is 100 times more than the Berlin city centre. The switch between 
solid fuel and gas or kerosene improves air quality by 10 times. A little less
optimistically, the purchase of an improved stove design still results in a
decrease in pollution from 50 to 90%. This gives an idea of the magnitude of
cost effectiveness in targeting the global poor.</p>
<p><img alt="The link between income and fuel usage - Copyright WHO 2006" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/the-energy-ladder-household-energy-and-development-inextricably-linked-who-2006.png"></p>
<p>The good news is that tackling global poverty is a well-researched area with
plenty of cost effective choices. With our remaining budget of 22 per month, we can
donate to <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>, where you can, well
... simply give that money to the extreme poor. This
is almost equivalent to 1 year of their universal basic income initiative (0.75$ per
day - compared to the global poverty line of 1.25$ per day), where they can
rebuild their lives. The results show that they spend this on assets and
nutrition primarily, with a resultant increase in earning, lifting them out of
the global poor.</p>
<p>If you wanted to explore other more directly related initiatives to explore
would be those such as
<a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-eating-moss-cleans-hotspots-europe">CityTrees</a>,
the <a href="https://www.catf.us/">Clean Air Task Force</a>, the <a href="https://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/policy-governance/en/">World Health
Organisation</a>,
the <a href="https://www.ccair.org/clear/">Coalition for Clean Air</a>, or one of many
<a href="https://smokelesscookstovefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SCF-Khandwa-Report-October-1st-2018-1.pdf">Smokeless cooking
initiatives</a>
that swap out cooking equipment in poor countries.</p>
<p>Without any other stronger quantitative foundation, in addition to my own switch
to 100% green energy, I have chosen to target the global poor, rather than more
direct approaches. I would encourage readers to decide what approach suits them
best and to do their own research.</p>
<p><strong>Result: ~22USD per month</strong></p>
<h2>A budget for a net-positive life</h2>
<p>Our final monthly budget is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>14USD donated to Cool Earth</li>
<li>7USD donated to the Albert Schweitzer Foundation</li>
<li>9USD donated to the Hunter Estuary Wetlands</li>
<li>64USD donated to the WWF</li>
<li>19USD donated to the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute</li>
<li>22USD donated to GiveDirectly</li>
</ul>
<p>This totals 135USD per month, or 1,620USD per year, which is 5% of a 32,400USD yearly income. It
covers a large range of issues, chosen to reflect the various dimensions of our
non-anthropocentric production and consumption as a species.</p>
<p>The budget demonstrates that with a small donation it is possible to actually
make a large and measurable impact as an individual. These calculations have
been extremely conservative on purpose, and I have refused to double count
benefits (e.g. work by the WWF would also have impacts on the carbon
footprint, but I did not count it twice). I should warn, however, that I am
not a subject matter expert, and so if you are more experienced in any of the
fields I have mentioned in this article and can help suggest improvements,
please send me an email!</p>
<p>Net-positive living is just the beginning! There are so many other important
issues to consider in the world, and if you make more than 32,400USD (pre-tax)
per year, perhaps you can donate even more than the small budget I set in this
article. Please feel free to explore <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We
Can</a>, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>,
and <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 hours</a>.</p>
<p>As a final note, I should emphasize that in this article, I have only focused
on the financial. Financial ballparks are not the only approach nor guaranteed
to be the best approach to the world's problems. In fact, there are <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zdAst6ezi45cChRi6/list-of-ways-in-which-cost-effectiveness-estimates-can-be">many ways
where cost-effective estimates are
misleading</a>.
Personally, I believe that <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Yix7BzSQLJ9TYaodG/ethical-offsetting-is-antithetical-to-ea">ethical offsetting is not
enough</a>,
and it is absolutely vital to also change our behaviours - to recycle when
possible, to choose renewable sources, and to reduce our materialism. Everybody
will have their own unique and valuable contributions to the world, so I urge
all readers to research, evaluate, and do the best you can, in your own way.</p>

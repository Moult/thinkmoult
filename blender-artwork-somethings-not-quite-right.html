<p>It's not often that I show my Blender artwork nowadays, but here's three
samples that I hope you'll appreciate.</p>
<p>Oh look. A tree with a rock.</p>
<p><img alt="Hmm" src="The-Indiscernible-1024x1024.png"></p>
<p>No wait. That's not a rock. It's a heart.</p>
<p>Yep, definitely a heart.</p>
<p>Those leaves aren't right. What is it?</p>
<p>But wait, there's more!</p>
<p><img alt="Ahum" src="The-Imperceptable-1024x1024.png"></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure these are hands. Perhaps more than one.</p>
<p>Yeah, more than one.</p>
<p>How about something lighter?</p>
<p><img alt="Bubbles" src="Earth-and-Territory.png"></p>
<p>I didn't say this post would make sense :) But such is the nature of
this type of artwork.</p>
<p>Yadda yadda yadda.</p>

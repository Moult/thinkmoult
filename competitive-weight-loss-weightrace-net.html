<p>So last year (or perhaps even the year before, time flies!) two people
close to me participated in a friendly weight-loss competition. To do
this, they used <a href="http://weightrace.net">WeightRace.net</a>.</p>
<p>WeightRace is a small web application I built a while ago for fun, which
allows up to four contestants to compete towards a weight goal which
they would set. They would be prompted daily for weight updates, and
would set a reward for the winner. It also used some lightweight
gamification so contestants could earn bonus "wobbly bits" when
achieving things like their BMI.</p>
<p>But enough talking about the application -- applications are boring!
Much more interesting are results! Let's see:</p>
<p><img alt="WeightRace - competitive weight loss" src="weightrace.png"></p>
<p>The two contestants -- whom we shall refer to as Rob and Julie, which
may or may not be their real name -- and their results are shown in the
graph above. Julie is red, Rob is blue, and their linear trajectories
towards their weight goal is shown via the corresponding coloured dotted
line.</p>
<p>If I could hear a sped-up commentary of the results, it would truly be
exciting! Rob makes an excellent head-start well ahead of his
trajectory, whereas Julie is having trouble beginning. As we near the
holiday (Christmassy) season, we see Rob's progress plateauing, whereas
Julie gets her game on and updates with a rigorous discipline. Also
great to notice is the regular upward hikes in Julie's weight - those
correspond with weekends! As the holidays pass, Rob makes gains and is
unable to recover.</p>
<p>In the end, although Julie wins the Race, neither Julie or Rob met their
weight goal (note that in terms of absolute figures, Rob actually wins).
However, this was all not in vain. Given that almost another year has
passed since this race finished, and I can see that Rob's weight is now
well under control and has indeed achieved his goal, I'd like to think
that the WeightRace has played a role.</p>
<p>In particular, the WeightRace helped raise daily awareness. I believe
that it was this daily awareness of the current weight that helped most
in the long-term. In addition, the WeightRace helped Rob's body to
stabilise around 90kg for half a year! I suspect his body figured out
that it could manage at that weight, which made it easier for him to
(after the WeightRace) continue to lose weight at a healthy pace.</p>
<p>For those interested in playing with the WeightRace, you can check it
out online at <a href="http://weightrace.net">WeightRace.net</a>. Note though that
it is not actually complete, but works good enough for a competition.
For those interested in the source, it's up on my
<a href="http://github.com/Moult">GitHub</a>.</p>

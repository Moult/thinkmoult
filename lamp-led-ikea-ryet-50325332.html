<p><img alt="Preview of the lamp LED Ikea Ryet 50325332" src="pic/lamp-led-ikea-ryet-50325332.png"></p>
<p>This is a lamp model based off the LED Ikea Ryet 50325332, which is a clear
chandelier or candelabra lamp / bulb. The lamp model does not include the screw,
as it is unlikely to be visible in any render, but is provided in the
specification below should you want to model it yourself. This particular Ikea
product is no longer sold.</p>
<p>The SKU of the product is provided to prevent confusion with many similarly
named but different looking Ryet lamps sold by Ikea across the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>220-240V</li>
<li>50/60Hz</li>
<li>2.8W</li>
<li>200lm</li>
<li>2700K</li>
<li>LED1525C3</li>
<li>E14</li>
</ul>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>The colours have been calibrated with Macbethcal but the specularity and
roughness values are guessed.</p>
<p>Ikea does not supply IES files of their products. The actual product contains a
rather interesting reflector which casts an interesting light distribution.
However, as there is no Ikea IES file provided, I have substituted the light
bulb with a much more bland light, the <a href="https://lighting.cree.com/products/indoor/lamps/a19-series">omnidirectional 2700K A19 lamp by
Cree</a>. This IES file
is of the A19 40W variant, which produces more than double the lumen output of
the original lamp.</p>
<p>To reiterate, <em>this lamp is no longer sold, and does not have a matching IES
file</em>. This means that <em>you should not use this lamp for an accurate
reproduction of a specified lamp</em>. If you simply need a generic lamp that
someone might get cheaply off the shelf somewhere but isn't the focus of your
light simulation, this lamp may be alright.</p>

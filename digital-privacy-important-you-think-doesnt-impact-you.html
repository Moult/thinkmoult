<p>The average person (or business entity) publicly shares their personal
information on the internet. If you search with Google, send email with
Gmail, talk with Facebook Messenger, and browse the Web with Chrome, you
are being tracked. These free services, and many more, store and analyse
your personal messages, search history, cloud photos, and the websites
you visit. This information is readily available to governments,
hackers, or really any business or person who is interested and willing
to pay (law firms, journalists, advertisers, etc).</p>
<p>This is not news to most people. You have perhaps experienced an
advertisement pop up suddenly related to a website you visited that you
thought was private. You have probably had Facebook recommend new
friends who you just met a week ago. However, these are all rather
benign examples that don't warrant paranoia over your digital security.</p>
<p>As part of my <a href="../2018-new-years-resolutions/article.md">2018 new years
resolution</a> I have
been taking a closer look at my online privacy. Many people have
questioned me on it and so I thought I would address it in a blog post.
To begin with, I'd like to refer you to a great <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters">TED Talk on Why Privacy
Matters</a>.
Take 20 minutes to watch it and come back.</p>
<p><img alt="Glenn Greenwald - TED - Why Privacy
Matters" src="6992aa456af79721f493686c804324356781ddea_2880x1620.jpg"></p>
<p>For those too lazy to click, Glenn Greenwald makes the point that we
don't behave the same way in the physical world and the virtual world.
In the physical world, we lock our houses, cover our PIN at the ATM,
close the curtains, don't talk about business secrets in public, and use
an empty room when having a private conversation. This is largely
because we understand that in the physical world, we can open unlocked
doors, glance at PIN keypads, peek through curtains, listen to company
gossip, and overhear conversations.</p>
<p>In the virtual world, we are unfortunately uneducated about how to snoop
on other's private information. We assume that sending an email on Gmail
is private, or opening an incognito mode browser hides everything. This
is far from the truth: mass surveillance is relatively cheap and easy,
and there are many organisations that are well invested in knowing how
to snoop. However, for the most of us, we only experience this through
tailored advertising. As a result, there is little motivation to care
about privacy.</p>
<p>In this post, I will not talk about how you are tracked, or how to
secure yourself. These are deep topics that deserve more discussion by
themselves. However, I do want to talk about why privacy matters.</p>
<p>The right to privacy is a basic human right. Outside the obvious desire
to hide company secrets, financial and medical information, we behave
differently when we are being watched. You can watch adult videos if you
close the door, buy different things if you don't have a judgmental
cashier, and talk about different things on the phone if you aren't
sitting on a train in public.</p>
<p>Again, these are benign and socially accepted norms. However, there are
people living in countries where the norm is largely biased against
their favour. Global issues like corruption and political oppression
exist, even though many of us are lucky to turn a blind eye. Victims of
these countries are censored, incarcerated, and killed. See for yourself
where your country ranks in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_freedom_indices">list of freedom
indices</a>.</p>
<p>In these societies, a greater percentage of the population start to be
impacted by the poor digital security that we practice. We can see this
in the following graph, which shows the usage of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">The Tor
Project</a>, a tool that anonymises Internet
traffic, correlating with political oppression (<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444816639976?papetoc=">read the original
study</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="Correlation of Tor usage and political
repression" src="1459953210826319.jpeg"></p>
<p>Further investigation shows that Tor usage (see <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/metrics-web.git/tree/src/main/resources/doc/users-q-and-a.txt">how Tor statistics are
derived</a>)
similarly correlates to politically sensitive events. As of writing this
post, I rewinded the clock to the three most recent political events
that occurred in countries which experience censorship and political
oppression.</p>
<p>First, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_National_Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China">19th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China</a>.
You can see the tripling in activity as this event occurred. The red
dots show potential censorship.</p>
<p><img alt="Chinese Tor usage spikes during the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of
China" src="userstats-relay-country-cn-2017-10-01-2017-10-31-on.png"></p>
<p>Similarly, we can see a turbulent doubling in value during the <a href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/147132/social-media-goes-down-in-pakistan/">blocks
of social media and TV channels in
Pakistan</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Pakistan Tor usage during the social media
block" src="userstats-relay-country-pk-2017-10-15-2017-12-15-on.png"></p>
<p>Finally, a spike of usage and statistically relevant censorship /
release of censorship events during the <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/post/2018-iran-protests/">anti-government protests in
Iran</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Iran Tor usage spikes during Protests in Iran, blocking of various
services including
Tor" src="userstats-relay-country-ir-2017-12-01-2018-01-20-on.png"></p>
<p>These three events were simply picked as the most three recent political
events. Whether they are good or bad is largely irrelevant and I hold no
opinion on them whatsoever. However, it is clear that others do have an
opinion, and are using services like Tor as a reaction. Of course, it's
not just Tor. For example, a couple weeks ago, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/01/28/30000-accused.html">30,000 Turks were
incorrectly accused of treason from a 1x1 tracking
pixel</a>. This
results in jobs, houses, and innocent lives being lost. In the US,
Governors are still signing in support of Net Neutrality.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, there are those that believe that as long as we do
not do anything bad, there is nothing to hide. Privacy tools are used by
criminals, not the common population. This is also untrue. The
definition of "bad" changes depending on who is in power, and criminals
are motivated individuals who have much better privacy tools than most
will ever have. Statistically, increasing the <em>basic</em> awareness of
privacy does not increase criminal activity, but does increase
protection of the unfairly oppressed.</p>
<p>Those who are fortunate enough to live a complacent digital life tend to
decrease the average awareness of digital privacy. Just as we donate
relief aid to countries that experience wars or natural disasters, we
should promote awareness about digital freedom on the behalf of those
who do not have it. Nurturing a more privacy aware generation -a
generation who is born with a tablet in their hands- is a responsibility
to ensure that social justice and the expression of the marginalised
population remains possible.</p>
<p>Next up, I'll talk a bit about what tracking does occur, and what
privacy tools are out there.</p>

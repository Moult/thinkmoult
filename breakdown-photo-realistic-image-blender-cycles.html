<p>Recently, I wanted to produce a sample photo-realistic 3D scene with
Blender's Cycles engine that I could attempt to recreate in other
rendering engines. I took an almost random photo of a street and kerb
junction that is prolific throughout Sydney's suburbs. Here's that photo
below. You can see incredible features that we take for granted such as
the viscous bulging of the asphalt as it hits the kerb, dead eucalyptus
leaves, a groove between two concrete blocks, and so on. It's a slightly
over-exposed shot, hence we have an unnaturally bright grass.</p>
<p><a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/20180125_183312.jpg"><img alt="Source image" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/20180125_183312-1024x576.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The resultant 3D equivalent is below, all modeled, textured, and
rendered in Blender. I've thrown in a glossy
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#Suzanne">Suzanne</a> and
sphere, as well as a creative oil slick on the asphalt. You can click on
the images to see a high-resolution version.</p>
<p><a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/render-large.png"><img alt="Rendered image" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/render-large-1024x576.png"></a></p>
<p>The modeling itself is ridiculously easy. Excluding the particle systems
and dummy meshes, the road and kerb adds up to 5 polygons. The split in
the middle of the kerb is because I suspect the kerb rose in level a
bit, although I ended up ignoring it. This is typically the level of
detail you can expect from an architectural scene where only the road
level and sidewalk level matters.</p>
<p>You'll notice there are no lights. The photo was taken during an
overcast sky, and so an overcast sky environment map (+-4 EV) was used
for lighting. The environment map was largely untouched as it was an
overcast sky, and so we don't need to worry about the sun's impact on
the EV range.</p>
<p>Off to one side are some of the meshes used in the particle systems.
This spot was below a eucalyptus tree, and so various eucalyptus leaves
and other debris needed to be placed. The leaves, grass, and mulch are
dumb planes, and only the leaves actually have a texture applied. The
leaf texture was not a photo, and instead was from a <a href="http://www.jennybarron.co.uk/eucalyptus.html">beautiful
eucalyptus leaf painting</a>
by a talented artist.</p>

<p>The basic texture layer adds the first layer of realism. These are all
pretty standard, such as using this <a href="https://www.textures.com/download/asphaltcloseups0065/12434">seamless asphalt
texture</a>. I
have assigned a diffuse and normal map, and did minor colour correction
to the textures. What gives them that bit of realism is the dirt map I
have painted for worn edges, which darken the values to represent the
collection of dirt around edges, the gradient of dirt as water falls
towards the kerb, and the evaporation of dirt as it washes up against
the edge of the kerb before it finally spills over. Unlike its relative,
the occlusion map (which is faking a lighting phenomenon), this dirt map
actually does represent deposition of dirt and therefore a contrast
between the sun-bleached material and the darkened dirty material. There
is no specular map in this case, though there usually is for roads. The
map is shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="Road dirt map" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/road-edge-small.png"></p>
<p>To show the contrast between the effect a dirt map applies and a flat
texture, I've attached a work in progress screenshot below. You can see
the road which has a dirt map applied in contrast to the very fake
looking kerb.</p>

<p>The particle systems are what really give this scene a bit of life.
There are 5 particle systems in total: dead eucalyptus leaves, mulch,
long weedy Bermuda grass, short Bermuda grass, and dead grass fragments.
They are all weight-painted to place them on the scene, with a noise
texture to add colour variation to represent patchiness. An example of
the weight paint for mulch, and dead grass is seen below.</p>
<p><img alt="Mulch weight paint" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/mulch_small.png"></p>
<p>This gives a particle distribution which can be seen in the AO-pass
below.</p>
<p><a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/render-ao.png"><img alt="AO pass" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/render-ao-1024x576.png"></a></p>
<p>That's pretty much it! During compositing there was an AO pass
multiplied, colour correction applied, a sharpen filter, as well as a
slight lens distortion just for fun. A fully sized render takes about 10
minutes on my <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/../brand-new-gentoo-desktop-computer/article.md">Gentoo
machine</a>.</p>

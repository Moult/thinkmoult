<p>For the past few months, one of the projects I've been working on with
<a href="http://sevenstrokes.net">SevenStrokes</a> involves building a REST API for
a service. REST APIs are tricky things to get right: they're deceptively
simple to describe, yet play host to plenty of interesting topics to
delve into. Such topics can be statelessness, resource scope,
authentication, hypermedia representation and so on.</p>
<p>However I'm going to only talk about the very basics (which many people
overlook), and demonstrate how the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">Richardson Maturity
Model</a>
can help with automated testing and documentation. If you haven't heard
of RMM yet, I recommend you stop reading and go through it now
(especially if you've built a REST-like API before).</p>
<p>Let's say our REST API conforms to a level 3 RMM: we have a set of
standardised verbs, querying logical resources, receiving standardised
status codes, and being able to navigate the entire system via links.
We've got a pretty good setup so far. All these items in the RMM help
our REST API <em>system</em> scale better. However what is doesn't yet help
with is keeping our <em>documentation</em> up to date. This is vital, because
we know that <em>the holy grail for REST API is an auto-generated, always
up-to-date, stylish documentation that promotes your site/product api</em>.
There's a bunch of tools that help you do this right now, but I think
they're all rather half-baked and used as a bolt-on rather than a core
part of your application.</p>
<p>To solve this, I'm going to recommend one more addition: <em>every</em>
resource must have the <code>OPTIONS</code> verb implemented. When invoked, it will
respond with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <code>Allow</code> header, specifying all the other verbs available on the
    invoked resource.</li>
<li>A response body, containing the verbs, and under them in the
    hierarchy of the body (in whatever format), a description of:<ul>
<li>Their input parameters, including type, and required boolean</li>
<li>A list of example requests and responses, detailing what
    headers, parameters and body are included in the request, and
    what headers, status code and body is included in the response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A list of assumptions that are being made for each example scenario
    (if applicable)</li>
<li>A list of effects on the system for each example scenario (if
    applicable)</li>
<li>A list of links to any subresources with descriptions</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's see a brief example:</p>
<pre><code># OPTIONS /user/

{
    "GET": {
        "title": "Get information about your user",
        "parameters": {
            "foobar": {
                "title": "A description of what foobar does",
                "type": "string",
                "required": false
            },
            [ ... snip ... ]
        },
        "examples": [
            {
                "title": "View profile information successfully",
                "request": { "headers": { "Authentication": "{usersignature}" } },
                "response": {
                    "status": 200,
                    "data": {
                        "id": "1",
                        "username": "username1",
                        [ ... snip ... ]
                    }
                }
            },
            [ ... snip ... ]
        ]
    },
    [ ... snip ... ]
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "\/makkoto-api\/user"
        },
        [ ... snip ... ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Sound familiar? That's right. It's documentation. Better than that, it's
embedded documentation. Oh, and better still, it's auto-discoverable
documentation. And if that isn't great enough, it's documentation
identical to the format of requests and responses that API clients will
be working with.</p>
<p>Sure, it's pretty nifty. But that's not all! Let's combine this with
TDD/BDD. I've written a quick test here:</p>
<pre><code>Feature: Discover
    In order to learn how the REST API works
    As an automated, standards-based REST API client
    I can auto-discover and auto-generate tests for the API

    Scenario: Generate all tests
        Given that I have purged all previously generated tests
        Then I can generate all API tests
</code></pre>
<p>That's right. This test crawls the entire REST API resource tree
(starting at the top-level resource, of course), invokes OPTIONS for
each resource, and generates tests based on the documentation that
you've written.</p>
<p>Let's see a quick demo in action.</p>
<p><img alt="Auto-documentation for REST APIs in action" src="api2.png"></p>
<p>It's a really great workflow: write documentation first, generate tests
from it, and then zone in on your tests in detail. This ensure that your
code, tests and documentation are always in sync.</p>
<p>I hope someone finds this useful :) For the curious, the testing tool is
Behat, and output format used is application/hal+json, using the HAL
specification for linking, and link URI templates.</p>

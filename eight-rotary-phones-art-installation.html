    <article>

<p>Late last year, I helped run the University of Sydney annual graduation
exhibition for the Architecture faculty. One of the things I was
responsible for was helping set up an "artistic" installation.
Architects have strange concepts of what is and isn't art, and
apparently an isolated network of eight rotary phones qualifies.</p>
<p><img alt="An old rotary phone" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/rotary-phone.jpg"></p>
<p>The concept was simple: throw eight hipster phones around with a few
numbers and see what happens. You could call each other around the
building. I'm sorry, were you expecting more? Nope. That's art for you.</p>
<p>It did, however, give me an opportunity to learn the basics of
traditional phone systems - from things like pulses, tones, VOIPs, PABX,
switchboards, right down to the physical labour of installing more than
200 meters of phone cable across a building.</p>
<p>On the night itself, I'm happy to say that the installation (in both the
technical and artistic sense) was a success. I've never heard such
creative instant role playing or even inappropriate words said to
would-be employers.</p>
<p>... I wonder how long I can keep that phone network running before
people realise it's not a legitimate part of their system?</p>

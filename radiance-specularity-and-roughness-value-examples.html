<p>Most Radiance material definitions require a specularity and roughness value to
be set. Most 3D rendering programs have some sort of specularity and roughness
parameter, but these are not necessarily linked back to a measurable physical
property. In Radiance, these values are measurable.</p>
<p>However, unlike the diffuse RGB reflectance, which can be estimated through
greyscale charts and through calibration with <code>macbethcal</code> and a Macbeth
ColourChecker, it is a bit harder to measure specularity and roughness.</p>
<h2>How to measure specularity</h2>
<p>Specularity is not clearly defined in the Radiance reference manual. However, it
is basically the ratio of reflection that is specular and not diffuse. For
instance, the total surface reflectance of an object is given as so.</p>
<pre><code>total surface reflectance = diffuse reflectance + specular reflectance
</code></pre>
<p>An integrating sphere-based spectrometer measures the diffuse reflectance by
giving a measurement with the specular component excluded (i.e. what's left is
the diffuse component). It also measures the total surface reflectance by giving
a measurement with the specular component included (i.e. diffuse + specular
reflectance). Therefore you can calculate specularity as so:</p>
<pre><code>specularity = specular component / total surface reflectance
specular component = total surface reflectance - diffuse reflectance
specularity = (SCI - SCE) / SCI
</code></pre>
<p>However, not all of us have access to a spectrometer. Unfortunately, the only
alternative is to use more heuristic methods. One way is to simulate an object
under controlled conditions and compare it to a physical sample. Another way is
simply to make an educated guess. The good news is that our environment isn't
filled with extremely specular materials, and so a slight inaccuracy may not
harm the simulation too much, depending on what you are simulating.</p>
<h2>How to measure roughness</h2>
<p>Roughness is the root-mean-squared (RMS) facet slope of the surface. This is the
microscopic surface roughness: the more jagged the facets are, the rougher it is
and more blurry reflections will appear. Note that this is not the roughness
that is visible to the naked eye. Unless you have access to a very powerful
microscope, again, it's best to stick to a heuristic approach and fiddle with
the number until you get what you like.</p>
<h2>An intuitive example of specularity and roughness</h2>
<p>There are a few rules of thumb when guessing these numbers, which I've taken
from the Radiance reference manual:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most plastic (i.e. non-metallic) surfaces have a specularity of .0 to .1</li>
<li>Metallic surfaces generally have a specularity from .8 to .99, but are
   usually .9 or greater</li>
<li>Both plastic and metallic surfaces rarely exceed a roughness of .2</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/s98c33.pdf">Siggraph 1998 course</a>
gives some really great graphical examples of the difference in specular and
roughness values. I've copied the images here for reference, but they are not
produced by me and are the fine work and copyrighted by Rob Shakespeare.</p>
<p>This set of images describes specularity and roughness values for plastic
materials:</p>
<p><img alt="Plastic materials with a variety of specularity and roughness

<p>Here is the same for metallic materials:</p>
<p><img alt="Metallic materials with a variety of specularity and roughness
values" src="radiance-metal-specularity-roughness-s98.png"></p>
<p>As great as these images are, I find some bugbears. Firstly, the values tend to
jump around a bit instead of linearly. Secondly, although I'm sure it was a
fantastic work of art in 1998, 20 years later we might need a more modernised
test image, perhaps using higher-polygon models that we might typically use
nowadays.</p>
<p>I've recreated this benchmark image with this in mind. The principles are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show more complex geometry in the test image</li>
<li>Show more colours in the test image</li>
<li>Show a linear range of values</li>
<li>Place the geometry in a more complex environment</li>
</ul>
<p>I've used a basic sphere, the <a href="http://www.holmes3d.net/graphics/teapot/?graphics/teapot">Utah
teapot</a>, the <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">Stanford
bunny</a>, and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/primitives.html">Suzanne, the Blender
monkey</a>.
The materials are taken from the galvanised sheet metal that comes with the
sample <code>materials.rad</code> file with Radiance, and the remaining red, green
(foliage), and blue (sky blue) from the Macbeth ColourChecker chart. The range
of values are those that follow the rules of thumb above. Also, The geometry is
placed on top of a displaced rocky ground, with a skymap environment, where the
sky itself has been swapped out for a <code>gensky</code> sky.</p>
<p>All images are rendered using this publicly available <a href="https://gitlab.com/dionmoult/radiance-test-scene">Radiance test scene
repository</a>. After a
rendering, they are processed with <code>pcond -h</code>.</p>
<p>To start with, here is a comparison for plastic materials with different levels
of specularity and roughness. I recommend you <a href="plastic.png">download the high resolution
version</a>, to fully appreciate the differences.</p>
<p><img alt="Plastic examples of specularity and roughness" src="plastic-small.png"></p>
<p>Plastics differ from metallic materials in that the specular highlights of
plastics are white, whereas the specular highlights of metallic materials are
tinted. Here's an example.</p>
<p><img alt="A comparison between plastic and metallic materials" src="material-demo.png"></p>
<p>So here is a final chart of examples for metallic materials. Again, you can
<a href="metal.png">download the high resolution version here</a> to see the details.</p>
<p><img alt="Metal examples of specularity and roughness" src="metal-small.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, the effects can be quite subtle to notice, so I wouldn't stress
too much if the value isn't perfectly right. Feel free to use the repository to
create your own test images.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I was involved with an architectural project that involved
robotic stone wire-cutting. In short, we used diamonds and robots to create
interlocking stone blocks that could be cut with minimal material wastage. Here's
the story.</p>
<p>Diamond wires are sometimes used to cut semi-large
pieces of stone (in my case, sandstone) that had been quarried. The diamond
wire - a filament with couplings that have diamond shards embedded in them -
spins along two pulleys really fast, in a similar manner to a blade on a
bandsaw, which is then slowly pushed into the stone. Here's a picture of one in
action. </p>

<p>However, relative to other stone cutting tools, the diamond wire is not that
commonly used. You might use a wire to cut a huge slab of stone into two, and
then you'd shift to your saws and drills for the next stage. The saw would be
used to rough out the shape, and drill to get the details. Unlike the diamond
wire, which cuts cleanly through the block, the saws and drills break down all
the material up to the desired point on the surface, and creates a lot of
material wastage.</p>
<p>Simon Weir, Shayani Fernando, and myself worked at the University of Sydney to
devise an alternative approach to cutting stone. It turns out it's not entirely
a crazy idea to create a portable diamond wire bandsaw and attach it to the end
of a 6-axis robotic arm and have an arm cut stone. In fact, it's been done.
Let's take a moment to appreciate the sheer majesty of the contraption below.</p>

<p>So clearly, we can do this. Stone cut this way minimises waste and can create
some pretty funky shapes quickly. For prototyping, we built an el-cheapo version
out of resistance wire so that it could be used to melt foam for prototypes.
Here's an example of it attached to the robot.</p>

<p>There's another really interesting usecase of stone. In the natural world, stone
forms fascinating curvaceous shapes with plenty of cantilevers. That's because,
even though stone is primarily used as a compressive structural element, if it's
all in one piece it will support itself. Logistically, however, carrying and
installing large cantilevering stone pieces are expensive. It would be nice to
cut it into small stone blocks that could then by joined together again, but
retain their cantilever.</p>
<p>We came up with the concept of a wave-jointed block. This wave could be cut
without any material wastage by the diamond wire, and would interlock with
neighbouring stone pieces. Here it is prototyped. You can see how we can build
half an arch quite easily.</p>

<p>Here are more pictures of prototypes and cut in Carrara marble in Italy. Most of
these pictures are used with permission from <a href="http://shapesoftime.tumblr.com/">Shayani

<p>Depending on the stone, there are various issues with chipping on the edges, and
time taken to cut. Similarly, due to the wire, there will always be striation
marks visible - and an additional sanding process is required to remove it.</p>
<p>It's probably also worth mentioning that the blocks still require a grout
between them, to prevent the blocks from grinding against each other and
breaking down.</p>
<p><img alt="The team, next to more curved block structures" src="block-cutting-team.jpg"></p>
<p>This is an ongoing project and is currently continued by Shayani Fernando in
Switzerland. The research was presented at RobArch 2016, a few other places, and
most recently at some sort of design festival at University of Sydney again.
Here's the full team, currently expanded to include others who have taken the
research further.</p>

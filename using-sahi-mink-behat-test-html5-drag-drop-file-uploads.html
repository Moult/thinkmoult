<p>For those that don't know, <a href="http://behat.org">Behat</a> is an excellent
tool for testing the business expectations of an application. In other
words, it's a <em>behavior-driven</em> approach towards full-stack application
acceptance testing. <a href="http://mink.behat.org">Mink</a> is a browser
abstraction layer, allowing you to easily control different browser
emulators through a common interface. Combining the two together brings
us a mean bag of tricks when it comes to testing web applications.</p>
<p>This morning I had set myself the task of writing the tests for a spiffy
HTML5 drag and drop file upload script that is all the rage nowadays.
Needless to say it took far longer than I had thought it would. Let's
get started.</p>
<h2>Testable elements of the HTML5 drag and drop</h2>
<p>Drag and drops work by triggering the drop event of an element. This
drop event contains a list of files in a format defined by the HTML5
FileAPI. The Javascript can loop over these file objects and perform
client-side file validation checks. This data is then posted via AJAX to
another URL. After the server-side processing is done, we get a response
object with the results, and we parse these to give feedback to the user
whether the upload finally succeeded. As you can see, there are various
places we can begin to test.</p>
<h2>Attempt 1: Just test the AJAX POST</h2>
<p>Because the data is finally POSTed via AJAX, one option is to just test
that and leave the rest to manual QA. In fact, we can forego AJAX
altogther, and use PHP with cURL to make the request and check the
response. Easy. Actually, too easy - we're ignoring what makes our app
cool - the drag and drop!</p>
<h2>Attempt 2: Test the legacy file input fallback</h2>
<p>Bah. This isn't why you're reading this post. You <em>know</em> how to do this
already. And anyway, you've probably already got a legacy test but now
you want to test the spiffy HTML5 one. Moving on.</p>
<h2>Attempt 3: Use Sahi to run your test</h2>
<p>Hello <a href="http://sahi.co.in/">Sahi</a>! Sahi is a web test automation tool
with fully fledged GUI. But more relevant is that it supports
Javascript, unlike its faster headless relatives (yes, there's
PhantomJS, but I wouldn't mind seeing what's going on in a drag-and-drop
widget).</p>
<p>Before we even hit Mink and Behat, try recording the events to turn into
a Sahi script. You'll quickly notice that Sahi (unsurprisingly) doesn't
properly record the event of dropping a file onto the page.</p>
<p>The issue here is that Sahi has no concept of files <em>outside</em> the
emulated browser window. There's a sneaky trick around this. In our
Behat definition , we'll run <code>evaluateScript</code> to dynamically add a file
input field, then attach our image file to that field. Now we can grab
the file object from that!</p>
<pre><code>$session = $this-&gt;getSession();
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('$("body").after("&lt;input type=\"file\" id=\"sahibox\"&gt;")');
$session-&gt;getPage()-&gt;attachFileToField('sahibox', '/home/dion/image.png');
myfile = $("#sahibox").get(0).files[0];
</code></pre>
<p>If we run the Javascript manually, it works fine. And it also creates a
good opportunity to stop and peek at exactly what's your File object
built from. However in Sahi, we <em>don't</em> have the file object. Why?
Because input file field values cannot be manipulated by Javascript for
security reasons. But then why does Sahi even provide a function for
this? Because "Sahi intercepts the request in the proxy, reads the file
off the file system and inserts it into the multipart request". So Sahi
just does a sneaky slide into the form submit at the end.</p>
<p>Taking a peek at Sahi's <a href="http://sahi.co.in/w/_setFile">setFile
documentation</a>, they note they have a
<code>_setFile2</code> function - which essentially converts the input field into a
text field in the process. This isn't going to work either, because we
actually need the file object to test.</p>
<p>Finally, Sahi provides a third alternative to selecting files to uploads
by emulating native events in the process of selecting a file. It's at
the bottom of their setFile documentation. It basically walks through
the steps of opening up the file browse dialogue, typing in the file
path with keystrokes ... on and on until we get what we want. It'll
work!</p>
<p>Yes, it'll work. But not nicely. It's slow. It's littered with
<code>_waits()</code>. Wouldn't it be nicer if we could create the file object
ourselves rather than emulate browsing our filesystem?</p>
<h2>Attempt 4: Grab a file object from an image already on the server</h2>
<p>Aha! We've already got images in our app, let's just try to upload one
of those. We'll need two things: an image source, and a way to create a
file.</p>
<p>For an image source, we'll grab one with an <code>XMLHttpRequest()</code> in
Javascript. We need to make sure that this image source is within Sahi's
proxy, though. This is because otherwise we'd run into cross-domain
issues. That's fine, we'll upload the Sahi logo as our test image.</p>
<p>To create a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/file-upload/#dfn-file">File</a>, we'll
create a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/file-upload/#dfn-Blob">Blob</a> instead.
Files inherit from Blobs, and so we can swap them in an out. Right,
let's see.</p>
<pre><code>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open( "GET", "http://sahi.example.com/_s_/spr/images/sahi_os_logo1.png", true );
xhr.responseType = "arraybuffer";
xhr.onload = function( e ) {
    var arrayBufferView = new Uint8Array( this.response );
    window.myfile = new Blob( [ arrayBufferView ], { type: "image/png" } );
};
xhr.send();
</code></pre>
<p>Great! So <code>window.myfile</code> will be populated with our file object now.
But a test that relies on the existence of a Sahi image? Nasty.</p>
<h2>Attempt 5: Create our file object from a base64 string</h2>
<p>Simple but effective and none of that extra request messing around.
Let's create an image first. I made a black 100px square image for
testing. The simpler the image the better, as it'll make your base64
string smaller. Now let's turn that image into base64:</p>
<pre><code>$ base64 image.png 
iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAABkCAAAAABVicqIAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA
B3RJTUUH3gIYBAEMHCkuWQAAAB1pVFh0Q29tbWVudAAAAAAAQ3JlYXRlZCB3aXRoIEdJTVBkLmUH
AAAAQElEQVRo3u3NQQ0AAAgEoNN29i9kCh9uUICa3OtIJBKJRCKRSCQSiUQikUgkEolEIpFIJBKJ
RCKRSCQSiUTyPlnSFQER9VCp/AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==
</code></pre>
<p>Great. Now as it turns out, the folks at Mozilla have already worked out
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Base64_encoding_and_decoding#Appendix.3A_Decode_a_Base64_string_to_Uint8Array_or_ArrayBuffer">how to decode a base64 string into
Uint8Array</a>.
Steal their functions and we're good to go :)</p>
<p>So our test script will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert a base64 image into a Uint8Array</li>
<li>Use that Uint8Array to construct a Blob with the mimetype of
    image/png</li>
<li>Set various metadata that file uploaders need, such as file name and
    last modified date</li>
<li>Create a new list of files, and put our Blob in there</li>
<li>Create a new "drop" event.</li>
<li>Add our list of files to the dataTransfer attribute of that drop
    event</li>
<li>Trigger our on-page element with the drop event</li>
<li>Wait for the AJAX call and server-side processing to be done</li>
</ol>
<p>And here is the full script in action from our Behat definition (with
the base64 string snipped out because it's very long):</p>
<pre><code>$session = $this-&gt;getSession();
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('myfile = new Blob([base64DecToArr("...snip...")], {type: "image/png"})');
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('myfile.name = "myfile.png"');
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('myfile.lastModifiedDate = new Date()');
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('myfile.webkitRelativePath = ""');
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('sahiFileList = Array()');
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('sahiFileList.push(myfile)');
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('e = jQuery.Event("drop")');
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('e.dataTransfer = { files: sahiFileList }');
$session-&gt;evaluateScript('$("#dropbox").trigger(e)');
$session-&gt;wait(1000);
</code></pre>
<p>Great! It's testable!</p>

<p>A few months ago I was walking in the park near my university and
stumbled across a rather warped but stylish fallen branch. Immediately I
knew that this branch was destined to become an oil lamp. A couple
months later of on-and-off work, I had finished.</p>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/IMG_4333.jpg"></p>
<p>The lamp itself was made out of laminated rings of wood, which encased a
copper oil container. A sculpted nozzle allows the wick to raise out of
the wooden container and light up. The container is hinged and can be
refilled whilst the lamp is burning. The nozzle was made out of
laminated ply, whereas the alternating colours of the container were
various hardwoods. The heat distributors were zinc (if I recall right),
and the glass was cut out of an old soya bean milk bottle.</p>

<p>The branch itself didn't become the lamp, but rather the stand for the
lamp. The slight uneven and rustic look makes it suited more for the
outdoors, placed on top of lawn.</p>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/IMG_4323.jpg"></p>
<p>The wick passes through a wick raising mechanism. The design for the
mechanism, built from steel and aluminum, was actually taken by a patent
advertised by the <a href="http://lampguild.org/">International Guild of Lamp
Researchers</a> (yes, you read that right).</p>
<p>It consists of two cogs, one with pointed teeth, and another indented so
that they mesh together. These are encased inside a block with a two
channels - one for the cogs to fit into, and one for the wick to pass
between them. Turning the cog with teeth catches the wick, and allows
you to raise and lower the wick. This feeds in extra wick when existing
wick burns out, and allows you to "dim" and "brighten" the lamp.</p>
<p>Each cog spins on an axle, but the indented cog's axle has a extended
slot, and by twisting a screw outside, you can push the cogs closer to
one another. This allows the wick mechanism to accommodate for
differently sized wicks.</p>

<p>This entire project was built from scratch (with exception of the wick
and metal fastener at the top with the ugly blue plastic which was
bought), with thanks to the helpful folks over at the university
workshop.</p>

<p>All in all, I call this project a success. I've learned a ton about
woodwork and metalwork, and got myself a rather unique lamp in the
process. I hope you all enjoyed taking a peek too :)</p>

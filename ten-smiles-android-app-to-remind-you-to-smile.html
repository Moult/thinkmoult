<p>Ten Smiles was a concept Android app that would run in the background of your
Android phone, and pop up randomly 10 times a day to remind you to smile. I
wrote it a few years ago as a little programming exercise. Along with the text
reminder, it would additional show a happy face with a funny moustache, and a
horrible pun to accompany it with, all randomly chosen from a small repository
of puns and faces which gets old real quick. Let's see an example reminder!</p>

<p>Ten Smiles is pretty much plug and play. You just install the application from
this <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/tensmiles.apk">Ten Smiles Android installation APK</a>, and then toggle the
"Enable Ten Smiles" option in the app, and hit save. It will automatically
choose 10 random times each day roughly during non-sleeping hours, and will pop
up by itself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I no longer have the source code for this project as it was
merely an afternoon plaything a few years ago. However, I am not one for
inserting tracking codes or malware into my software as others may do - this is
evidenced by the static HTML nature of my blog.</p>

<p>This post is mostly just a reminder to myself, but it may be useful to
others. I was recently asked to convert a <code>.ppt</code>, or Powerpoint slideshow
document, into a three slides per page, horizontally centered, one on
top of another, with frames around each slide. Powerpoint itself offers
several printing options, including a 2<sup>n</sup> per page (ie. 2, 4,
8, etc) as well as handouts, which can do 3 per page but are incredibly
small and have writing lines besides the slides. Luckily, Powerpoint can
save the <code>.ppt</code> into a <code>.pdf</code>, and there are plenty of PDF manipulation
tools on Linux, and are generally much more readily available than on
Windows. Scribus is an option, but after some searching I discovered
<code>pdfnup</code>, part of the <code>pdfjam</code> package. This is the command I ended
up using:</p>
<pre><code>pdfnup --nup 1x3 --no-landscape --frame true --batch foo.pdf bar.pdf etc.pdf
</code></pre>
<p>For a full explanation of the commands, you can try looking at its
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/pdfnup">manpage</a>, or <code>pdfnup --help</code>, which
is much more useful.</p>

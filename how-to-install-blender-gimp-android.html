<p>It is possible to install Blender and The GIMP on Android, with the full
functionality just as their desktop counterparts. They can be installed as
native applications as long as we have a few prerequisites.</p>
<p>Blender and The GIMP do not have mobile / Android native interfaces, and so as a
result we will need to set up a Linux-based "X" server environment on the phone
so that their GUI will display, and the resulting interface will not be touch
friendly and requires a bluetooth mouse and keyboard to be much use. I should
also note that most Android phones are not as powerful as desktops, and so
performance will be limited, but it is useful to know that it can be done.</p>
<p>To start with, you will need to <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/../installing-gentoo-android-chroot/article.md">install Gentoo Linux on your Android
phone</a>. This is a
straightforward process, does not require root, and allows you to run Gentoo
inside a <code>chroot</code>, alongside your Android. As it's in a <code>chroot</code>, you can use Gentoo
through a terminal emulator. As we will require a desktop interface, you will
need to install <code>xorg-server</code>, a VNC server, and some sort of window manager (in
this case, I use <code>fluxbox</code>). I use Android's bVNC free app as a VNC client, as
it supports converting the screen to a touchpad, but you may choose any you
like.</p>
<pre><code>$ emerge xorg-server tigervnc fluxbox
$ vncserver -geometry 960x540
</code></pre>
<p>You can watch this video demonstrating a working <a href="https://peertube.social/videos/watch/ad395c9b-9702-4060-ac05-4c94b64956ab">Gentoo on Android on
Peertube</a>,
or embedded as a video below.</p>

<p>Finally, install Blender and The GIMP just as you would on a desktop. You will
need to unmask them as they are technically untested on an <code>arm</code> processor,
which your phone likely uses, but I can guarantee that it does compile, and
certainly works fine on my Samsung Galaxy S7.</p>
<pre><code>$ emerge blender gimp
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! As you have a full desktop environment, you can treat your phone
as a desktop and install desktop applications. You can watch a <a href="https://peertube.social/videos/watch/525aa253-5ef2-410f-b4e0-2c401064005d">video of Blender
and the GIMP running on Android</a> on Peertube here, or see my demonstration below. I also demonstrate real-time rendering with Cycles and rendering out a scene. The scene I use is a city generated from <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/../openstreetmaps-open-source-maps-application/article.md">OpenStreetMaps</a>.</p>

<p>In practice, I have found that I never tend to actually use Blender and the GIMP
on my phone, as the screen is too small and it is too slow. But as a proof of
concept I reckon it's pretty cool.</p>

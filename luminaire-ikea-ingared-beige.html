<p>The <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50424983/">Ikea Ingared beige</a>
is a typical cheap desk luminaire. It has a brushed metal anisotropic stand
(galvanized steel with acrylic coating), and a beige polystyrene (100%
polyester) shade.</p>
<p>This 3D model comes with a wire profile so you can model your own wire (only the
wire stub is included), as well as a switch so you may include the switch. The
switch model is shown in the preview adjacent to the luminaire. In reality, the
switch is placed about 100mm down the wire. A plug is not included with the
model.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a lamp to place inside this luminaire and aren't fussed
about a particular bulb, you can use the <a href="https://radiance.thinkmoult.com/html/lamp-led-ikea-ryet-50325332.html">LED Ikea Ryet 50325332 2700K
lamp</a>.</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>The colours have been calibrated with Macbethcal but the specularity and
roughness values are guessed.</p>
<p>A texture is provided to give the brushed anisotropic look. This is because it
is actually a fake texture in real life. A specular map is used to vary the
specularity of the brushing. Although the averages should be correct, the exact
specularity change is guessed.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This Radiance model follows the <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/proposed-radiance-filesystem-hierarchy-standard.html">Radiance Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard</a>. As
such, please run <code>make lib</code> to build the Radiance mesh file. Once done, you can
use this in your scene by:</p>
<pre><code>!xform lib/luminaire-ikea-ingared-beige/obj/luminaire.rad
!xform lib/luminaire-ikea-ingared-beige/obj/switch.rad
</code></pre>

<p>In a previous post, I talked about <a href="../robotic-stereotomy-stone-diamond-wire-cutting/article.md">using a diamond wire to cut
stone</a>. The wire
cutter would be attached to a 6-axis robot arm which would then be pushed
through the stone. If you haven't yet read it, read it now.</p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about the technical approach used.</p>
<p>The robotic arm that performed the cutting was a German KUKA robot, which processes a
proprietary toolpath instruction language known as KRL (KUKA Robot Language).
Given that there was no open-hardware robot available, this had to do. KUKA
robots come with a similarly proprietary simulation software, which is
horrendously expensive. Luckily, there is a cheaper, but mostly functionally
equivalent simulator called KukaPRC (some funky behaviour, but quite well done)
written for Grasshopper, which is the visual scripting language used by Rhino.</p>
<p>The visual scripting language comes with a set of nodes for drag-and-drop
create-your-own toolpath. Although one valid approach was to parameterise the
shape of each block and use Grasshopper to generate toolpaths, we had a wider
goal of more generic toolpath generation due to strangely cut shapes.</p>
<p>The good news is that every shape's surface is already parameterised in the form
of the surface UV. Given a clean mesh topology with a lot of quads, we figured
that the wire could simply follow edge rings, starting with U, an following V,
until it had carved up the required shape.</p>
<p><img alt="Edge loops and edge rings which create a natural
toolpath" src="edge-loops-and-edge-rings.png"></p>
<p>The KRL syntax in its simplest form supports an XYZ for the toolhead location,
along with a tool axis vector and tool "up" vector. The XYZ is all relative to a
datum which is calibrated at the beginning. The datum would be an arbitrary
point on the jig which would hold the stone. Each edge in the edge ring would
represent the toolhead axis, and the midpoint of the edge would represent the
toolhead XYZ location. The "up" vector would be logically chosen to minimise
robot arm clashes.</p>
<p>I used Blender with a quick Python script to create the necessary vectors for
the toolpath. Seams were used to denote where the cuts stopped and started,
making the workflow similar to how any existing texture artist would work. This
would also resolve any issues with poles made in the surface topology.</p>
<p>Using Blender with quad-meshes created a very fluid workflow between scanning
rocks, retopologising, and generating toolpaths. The Blender script would then
spit out a KRL file which we could feed into the Grasshopper-based simulator, as
a final sanity check before actually carving up stone.</p>
<p>Because actually carving stone is slow and expensive, we would prototype with a
hot-wire cutter (resistance wire with a haphazardous power pack tied to it) and
styrofoam. If you clamp the foam down at the bottom and use dense foam, it sort
of doesn't move around too much.</p>
<p><img alt="Carving foam using toolpaths generated from edge
loops" src="cutting-foam-block.png"></p>
<p>By the time I write this post, all the languages, robot APIs and scripts would
be deprecated, and so is probably not worth digging up and sharing. However, the
principle of edge loops and seams as a workflow was really quite intuitive, and
thought the concept was worth a post.</p>
<p>Most toolpath generation techniques, however, do not have intuitiveness to the
user as their top priority. Most also do not take into account surface striation
patterns. Most would have a much more sensible goal such as minimising tool
wear, or material wastage, or robot movement efficiency. This approach does
absolutely none of that and is therefore useless for any proper production.
Still, pretty slick for rapid prototyping.</p>

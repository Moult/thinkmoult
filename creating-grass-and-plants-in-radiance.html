<p>Radiance is not often used to simulate fields of grass and heavily vegetated
scenes like those often created by CG artists with other rendering engines. This
is because exactly simulating the average luminance or illuminance on natural
environments is not often required. This article will demonstrate how to render
these types of scenes in Radiance.</p>
<p>The usual technique for rendering grass is to model some strands, and then place
instances of those strands using an automatic system, such as a "hair",
"particle", "duplivert", or "instancing" system that is provided with many
modeling software such as Blender. Sometimes, the vegetation is purely a series
of alpha-mapped plane. In other cases, such as for trees, the plant is generated
and leaves appear at locations defined by an L-system or similar. All of these
techniques can be used with Radiance.</p>
<p>As Radiance does not take shortcuts in its calculations, I would advise to
minmise the polygons where necessary when rendering vegetation. With grass,
don't model anything detailed. With groundcover and trees, use alpha mapped
planes as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Bake all the vegetation into a single mesh</h2>
<p>The simplest approach is to "bake" the generated vegetation into a static mesh
and export it as an OBJ, regardless of what generated it in the first place. The
mesh can then be included in a typical manner as described by my <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/../basic-rendering-tutorial-radiance/article.md">basic Radiance
beginners tutorial</a>. Despite
its simplicity, there are a few disadvantages of this approach: firstly, the
created OBJ can become extremely large, it also does not conserve memory on
repeated elements when rendering, and it is an all or nothing approach, it is
hard to turn on and off elements. That said, it is very, very easy, and so I use
this approach to create a planter bed in my <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/../photorealistic-rendering-with-radiance/article.md">living room Radiance render</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="A baked planter bed mesh with many polygons rendered in Radiance" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/planter-bed.jpg"></p>
<p>With Blender, there is a trick to export complex particle creations into a
single mesh without needing to bake it first, by linking the particle object
into a fresh file and then exporting an OBJ.</p>
<h2>Create many instances</h2>
<p>Another approach is to ask Radiance to copy and paste and object many times.
Radiance has an <code>instance</code> object, which places a precompiled octree into a
scene. This conserves memory when rendering. Although it is tempting to create a
single strand of grass and then instance it 10,000 times, I have found Radiance
is not capable of dealing with this. I have found more than 500 instances of a
single type of octree to cause Radiance to take a long time to prepare for
rendering, as well as octrees of incredibly thin aspect ratio (i.e. a grass
strand) to be very difficult for Radiance to handle.</p>
<p>That said, as long as you limit the instance to have a balanced aspect ratio,
such as a patch of vegetation, and do not go overboard in the number of
instances, then this is a valid technique. Here is an example of an instance you
might create which is not too long or thin.</p>
<p><img alt="An instance of a plant stem, which could be repeated many
times" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/stem-instance.png"></p>
<p>The instance is then placed multiple times with different locations and
rotations to build up complexity.</p>
<p><img alt="An example of many tufts of ferns instanced to create a scene" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/instance-example.png"></p>
<p>In Blender, there is a very easy way to do this, using a technique known as
<em>dupliverts</em>. With this technique, a mesh is created where each vertex
represents the origin of placing an instance. This Blender script automatically
converts these vertices into Radiance instances:</p>
<pre><code>import bpy
import math

# Path to the octree
octree = 'obj/bahia-grass.oct'
n = 0
with open('/tmp/particles.rad', 'w') as output:
    for vertex in bpy.context.active_object.data.vertices:
        output.write('void instance particle_{}\n5 {} -t {} {} {} \n0\n0\n\n'.format(
            n,
            octree,
            vertex.co[0],
            vertex.co[1],
            vertex.co[2],
        ))
        n = n + 1
</code></pre>
<p>This technique is especially useful when applied to groundcovers. A patch of
groundcover is created, and then simply repeated a few times until it becomes
convincing. I have released many types of plants in the <a href="https://radiance.thinkmoult.com/">free Radiance model
repository</a> where you can download and quickly
create vegetation yourself.</p>

<h2>Using alpha mapped planes for textures</h2>
<p>Alpha mapped planes are a standard technique in the CG industry. Here is how to
define it in Radiance. First, we define <code>diffuse-map</code>, this is the diffuse
texture that we will use for our object. Then, we will apply to this a plastic
shader. Our plastic shader multiplies the RGB values of the <code>diffuse-map</code> by 1.
For more information about how to set a diffuse map, you can read <a href="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/../use-macbethcal-to-calibrate-textures/article.md">how to use
macbethcal to calibrate
textures</a>.</p>
<p>Then, <code>my-material</code> is defined, which is what will be assigned to our actual
object, using UV coordinates. An <code>alpha-mask.hdr</code> is provided where white is
visible and black is invisible. The <code>mixpict</code> will mix between the <code>diffuse</code>
material and a <code>void</code> (i.e. invisible) material, depending on the <code>grey</code>
function, which reads greyscale data from <code>alpha-mask.hdr</code>.</p>
<pre><code>void colorpict diffuse-map
7 red green blue diffuse-map.hdr . frac(Lu) frac(Lv)
0
0

diffuse-map plastic diffuse
0
0
5 1 1 1 0 0

void mixpict my-material
7 diffuse void grey alpha-mask.hdr . frac(Lu) frac(Lv)
0
0
</code></pre>
<h2>Front and back face materials</h2>
<p>Plants are interesting from a material point of view because they often have a
different material from the front face of leaves and the backface of leaves. For
instance, the front face may be more specular or have a different colour.</p>
<p>This can be achieved in Radiance using a <code>mixfunc</code> as follows, which mixes
between the <code>frontface</code> and <code>backface</code> material, which is defined elsewhere.</p>
<pre><code>void mixfunc my-material
4 frontface backface if(Rdot,1,0) .
0
0
</code></pre>
<h2>Creating variations in colour</h2>
<p>With autogenerated particle or hair systems, often colour can be varied. This
can also somewhat be achieved in Radiance. One approach is to modify the
instance script above to select from several preset octrees, each compiled with
a different material. </p>
<p>Another approach is to use a calculation. Here is a crude example, saved as
<code>random.cal</code>, which pumps out a gradient of RGB along an objects local UV
coordinates.</p>
<pre><code>{ A1 = 0-1, where 0 has no variation and 1 varies the colour to 0}
{
red = (((Lu + Lv) / 2) * A1) + (1 - A1);
green = (((Lu + Lv) / 2) * A1) + (1 - A1);
blue = (((Lu + Lv) / 2) * A1) + (1 - A1);
}
red = (((Lu + Lv) / 2) * A1) + (1. - A1);
blue = (((Lu + Lv) / 2) * A1) + (1. - A1);
green = (((Lu + Lv) / 2) * A1) + (1. - A1);
</code></pre>
<p>It is then applied as follows:</p>
<pre><code>void colorfunc random-color
4 red green blue random.cal
0
1 .25
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="Preview of the 2 panel sliding door" src="pic/door-sliding-to-right-2-panel-1750w-2010h.png"></p>
<p>This double sliding door is in my house. It has a structural opening of 1750mm
wide and 2010mm high. It has two panels and operates by sliding to the right. It
is a glazed door with a clear glazing on both panels and has a white metal
frame. The glazing has a decal vision strip. The handle is black metal with a
key hole.</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>The colours have been calibrated with Macbethcal but the specularity and
roughness values are guessed.</p>
<p>The glazing is selected using the glaze database as a single pane of clear
glass. This is not necessarily correct, but close enough for the likely usecase
of this door.</p>

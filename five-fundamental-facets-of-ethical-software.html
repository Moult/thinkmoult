<p>The computing world has changed significantly since the web matured. We now have
centralised services monopolising most of the internet traffic, several
industries still running completely proprietary software, and the internet of
things which is slowly permeating through people homes.</p>
<p>What does this mean? For most of us who aren't familiar with the work done by
the Free Software Foundation, we are unaware of the implications of how our
digital lives have changed. We have entrusted more and more of our personal
lives into digital services, but have these digital services grown to support
us the best way they could have?</p>
<p>Allow me to use an analogy. Imagine you are buying a house. In this parallel
world, you only have the choice of 3 house designs. As usual, a company will
build the house for you. However, they will not tell you what is in your house,
there will be some locked doors that you can't open, and when something is
broken, you have to ask them to fix it. You're also not entirely sure if the
house complies with the government fire resistance requirements, because the
government hasn't certified it. They also own the spare key, and will randomly
decide to enter your house without asking to "upgrade" unspecified aspects of
it. Every so often, you're prohibited from placing certain furniture in the
house, and occasionally they will throw away some of your furniture without
asking. In a few years, you will be asked to leave your house, and buy a new
house from the same company, otherwise all your furniture will be thrown out.
Also, there's a microphone by your bedside, and a CCTV camera in your bathroom.</p>
<p>If this scenario sounds absolutely ridiculous to you, that's because it is.  If
you replace "house" with any other personal electronic device you own, such as
computer or phone, this is exactly what is happening with society right now.
Maybe you shouldn't bring your phone with you to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Software wasn't always like this. Richard M. Stallman, the foremost advocator
for software freedom, first observed that with software, either you control the
software, or the software controls you. If we lose control of software, vendors
become increasingly opaque on their processes. Their priorities shift from
developing software to benefit users, to developing software to maximise
profits. When profits become the driving factor, companies no longer hesitate to
make decisions that harm society. They promote the ignorance of users, create
profiles that can be used for authoritarian means, control communication, hinder
innovation and self expression, and monopolise markets. In fewer words, Richard
remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Companies tend to lose their scruples when that is profitable"</p>
<ul>
<li>Richard Stallman</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We see this trend blatantly happening around us. For instance, the majority of
web traffic filters through Google who profiles your behaviour in order to
create psychological profiles to maximise advertising profits. Google realised
that providing search results that were correct were less profitable than
showing you results for things you were inclined to believe, regardless of
their factual validity. This resulted in YouTube's and Google's results
agorithm creating a positive feedback loop encourage extremist behaviour,
pushing people towards violence and binarism.</p>
<p>To mitigate the issue of software being developed against the interests of the
public, I will describe 5 fundamental facets the allow a software to remain <em>in
control</em> by the users, keep the software <em>honest</em>, and by extension, prioritise
<em>people over profit</em>.</p>
<h2>The data should be open data</h2>
<p>All software needs to store and communicate data to one another. If the data
format is closed and proprietary, it cannot evolve to meet the needs of the
public, or be inspected by the public that it is truly correct. It also means
that you can only inspect it using a limited set of tools which are not under
your control. It is likely to be inefficient, store unwanted data, and the user
has to trust that their data is recorded correctly, with no way to validate it.</p>
<p>Open data should have formats that have publicly available specifications that
describe their syntax, grammar, tokens, parsing, and so on. This allows anyone
to additionally adapt the data to their own needs, since the rules are so
clearly spelled out in the specification.</p>
<p>Open data should also ideally have some form of plain text interpretation. Even
better so if that plain text is human understandable to the extent that humans
can author data themselves with a text editor without the need for software.
This allows humans to inspect the data easily, and allows a human to be critical
of the quality of data produced by software.</p>
<p>The good news is that there open data standards for almost any industry. Where
one does not exist, it is also easy to store things in plain text, and to follow
the Unix philosophy to think about universal text streams being piped from one
to another.</p>
<h2>The software should be open-source</h2>
<p>Proprietary software where the only developers are part of a secret club is not
conducive to public inspection of whether or not the software is being true to
its purpose. As a result, it quickly succumbs to the profit motive and develops
features that attempt to monetise its users, often with the side effect of
privacy violations, limiting their exposure to opportunities that could improve
the world, or creating anti-social situations.</p>
<p>As a result, software should be created by the community. That is, not only
open-source, but the core developers should be welcoming to all contributors and
unafraid of forks.</p>
<p>These days, there are plenty of quasi-open-source projects where the source is
available, but it is held on a tight leash. The phrase "open-source" is simply
used as a marketing tool but does not represent the actual scenario. It is even
worse when proprietary tools promote a so-called "open-source" ecosystem of
modules and plugins. These projects are <em>liars</em>.</p>
<p>The good news is that it is easy nowadays to open-source a project. Being a good
maintainer is another story, but open-sourcing things is a good start.</p>
<h2>The deployment process should be independently verifiable</h2>
<p>Once software is developed in an open-source manner and uses open-data formats,
it has to be deployed onto a machine. This can be simple as compiling it on a
computer, downloading a binary, or running it as a network-accessed service.
This deployment process represents an opportunity for a malicious actor to
modify the software to their own ends.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to check that the software we are running is true to the
open-source code that we have inspected. In some cases, you can simply compile
it yourself, and then you are sure to use the version of the software that the
codebase describes. You will first need to obtain the source code using methods
that cannot be compromised - this can be through open source and open data
protocols such as <code>git</code>, or by verifying that a package matches a precomputed
hash, or are signed by developers. Many Linux distributions offer this feature.</p>
<p>If you are downloading a binary, things become harder. A level of verification
can still be determined using hashing and signing, but it is less trustworthy
than the ability to compile the source yourself. Software projects that have
lengthy, complex, build procedures that discourage the public to build from
source are doing a disservice to user rights.</p>
<p>Some software is not deployed on your machine at all. This describes most
services we access on the internet. Unless you run your own email server, it is
unlikely that you have verified that your email provider only runs the necessary
software for email processing, and doesn't run other proprietary tools or store
secret non-open data for other purposes that you are unaware of.</p>
<p>It is technically possible to solve this problem, using crowd-distributed
deployment processes where multiple parties verify the validity of the
deployment, similar to how blockchain works. However, although technically
possible, it is a waste of resources.</p>
<p>Other strategies we can muse upon are run-time hashes which expose build-time
procedures and dependencies, or third-party deployment inspections, but again,
these are complex.</p>
<p>Any service which forces a non-local deployment is a form of abstracting the
control of data away from users. They should be discouraged, as the long-term
trend represents a full abstraction of data processing services and the complete
ignorance of the user to comprehend the full stack of software required to
process the data. This is already happening now, where some web developers are
unaware of the full stack of web-related software required to serve even simple
static files over the internet.</p>
<h2>The software hosting should be decentralised</h2>
<p>Once the software is deployed, the software host represents another opportunity
to modify the program, replace it with a lookalike, or observe the environment
and infer information for its own purposes.</p>
<p>This is a not a problem for purely local software - a user can run and deploy an
open-source operating system and environment for it to run on. If they want to
run it on another computer, they can do the same, assuming that the software
supports that platform. For this reason, having cross-platform support is a
feature of decentralised local software.</p>
<p>However, there are software which are networked in some way. To mitigate this, a
common protocol should be established for the software to communicate, and the
network should be decentralised. Like email, or the more recent ActivityPub
extension, this allows anybody to run it themselves, and not be cut off from a
wider network.</p>
<p>Any centralised network represents a single opportunity for malicious activity,
and discourages the independence and freedom of individual users to grow the
network organically.</p>
<h2>End-to-end encryption should be possible</h2>
<p>The final facet to consider is when the software is in use. Users should have
the right to protect their behaviour with the software, especially as users
record more and more of their lives digitally.</p>
<p>For local software, the software data does not necessarily leave the system that
it is deployed and hosted on. In this case, users should be aware of similarly
free and open-source standards for encrypting their data. These already exist,
such as using PGP encryption.</p>
<p>Again, software that is networked creates a problem. Network communications are
often poorly designed for user privacy. The networked software should be
designed in a way that any inputs can be encrypted on the client-side that
accesses the networked service, before being decrypted on the other end, and
ensure that the message cannot be modified in the process. Software such as
XMPP's OMEMO encryption extension demonstrate how this can be done.</p>
<h2>It's not just ethical software</h2>
<p>It's important to note that although this article has focused on software, these
trends of increased abstraction and opaque processes apply to many industries.
If you think it is hard to build software that achieves these ideals, you are
witnessing a much more systemic problem with society. We are too keen on wanting
more - and we want more faster and easier. We do not stop and think about
whether more is necessarily better.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

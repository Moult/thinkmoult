<p>On the 5th of December, there will be the Architecture Graduate
Exhibition at the University of Sydney. Yes, that's right, my Bachelors
degree is over! But before I move on to Masters, other projects, and
life, I would like to dedicate a post to the exhibition itself.</p>
<p>The Architecture Graduate Exhibition is an annual event which showcases
the work of all the graduating students. This year, it'll feature the
the graduating Bachelors, who show projects tackling the controversial
redevelopment of Flinders Street Station in Melbourne, and the
graduating Masters, who'll showcase three distinct projects. Our
organising team of five including myself are happy to present "ANALOGUE"
(that's an artsy theme, in case you haven't guessed).</p>

<p>If you are available in Sydney on the 5th of December, be sure to drop
in at the Wilkinson Building at 148 City Road around 6PM for live music
(which I shall participate), free booze (which I shall graciously
donate), and perhaps some design here and there.</p>
<p>This year shall also feature the release of the first online graduate
exhibition catalogue. This'll be reused in future years. It's still
under wraps but will be released at
<a href="http://usydarchexhibition.com/">UsydArchExhibition.com</a> once I have
enough entries. You may also follow our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Analogue-USYD-Architecture-Graduate-Exhibition/232128746943622">Analogue Architecture
Exhibition
Facebook</a>
page where we post ongoings - you might witness the 200 plinths we built
(don't mind the mess in the backdrop, that's the natural state of a
creative environment).</p>

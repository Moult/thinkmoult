<p>Three weeks ago, 30 kilometers away from the Sydney city centre in the
rural suburb of Edmondson Park, <a href="https://www.frasersproperty.com.au/">Frasers Property
Australia</a> opened the doors of
their display centre to the public. This brand new town centre
development with residential and retail environments was designed by
<a href="http://hdrinc.com/">HDR Inc</a>, of which I am part of the team of
architects. I haven't really talked much about my architecture work
before, but a brand new town centre in a previously uneventful part of
Sydney is perhaps worth a blog article.</p>
<p>Perhaps let's start with the blurb of the development which I've copied
directly from the <a href="https://www.frasersproperty.com.au/nsw/ed-square">Frasers official Ed Square
website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the makers of Central Park Sydney, Ed.Square brings inner city
edge, but with so much more than you expected.</p>
<p>Ed.Square is a diverse urban neighbourhood of restaurants and cafes;
shopping and entertainment; playgrounds and parklands; a market place
and Eat Street; adjacent to the Edmondson Park train station and all
within walking distance from your own front door.</p>
<p>Ed offers an array of residences crafted by some of the worlds best
architects that cater for every lifestyle. Whether you are a first
home buyer or a multi-generational family, you'll always feel at home
with Ed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sydney's South West is one of Sydney's growth trajectories, and so the
Edmondson Park development is one of those which will supply the
population growth.</p>
<p>Despite working on the development, I probably don't have any permission
to use any marketing material, so you'll have to visit the Frasers
website to see all the pretty pictures and marketing.</p>
<p>However, I did take some snaps of the display suite, so here it is!
Let's start with the view you get as you enter. To the left are some
display town houses. They are three storey products which surround the
town centre. If you use some imagination you can read that there is the
huge word "Ed." written in bright yellow in front of it. Ed's pretty
hip, and is the anthropomorphism of the neighbourhood. To the right, you
can see a cafe by the display centre itself, which apparently serves
some pretty tasty dishes that the local community loves -- but it was
closed when I arrived.</p>

<p>Here's what you see as you enter...</p>

<p>And a snap of the physical model...</p>
<p><img alt="Edmondson park model" src="20180602_160110.jpg"></p>
<p>Let's zoom in! The orange letter "T" is the train station, so you can
see that the town centre is literally adjacent to it. The white
buildings have yet to be released, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Here's another angle, showing the grand cinema facade.</p>

<p>There's a display apartment too ...</p>
<p><img alt="Edmondson Park display apartment" src="20180602_154811.jpg"></p>
<p>... which shows some of the apartment, such as this fancy kitchen.</p>

<p>Here's another view from the balcony of one of the town houses looking
at the display suite. In the background you can see a huge pit where
construction will occur, surrounded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Plain_Woodland">Cumberland Plain
Woodland</a>. I
hear there could be koalas living there.</p>

<p>Today we're going to take a brief look at Australia's electrical
infrastructure. The dataset is available publicly from <a href="http://services.ga.gov.au/">Geoscience
Australia</a>, but for those who don't dabble
in GIS software it can be a little hard to get to. I've put it all
together in <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>, and here's a few
snapshots for the curious. Now you can pretend you're an expert
electrical engineer and say judgemental things about Australia!</p>
<p>These maps cover major national powers stations, electricity
transmission lines, and substations. If you've ever wondered where your
electricity comes from, or how it gets to your house, this may give you
a brief idea of how it all fits together.</p>
<p>Let's start with Australia as a whole. Translucent circles represent
electrical power stations, and their size is weighted by the generation
capacity. For convenience, any power station that has a generation
capacity of greater than 250MW is labeled. Any non-renewable source is
shaded black, and renewables are shaded in red. Transmission power lines
are in red, and substations are the small red dots. Transmission lines
are weighted based on their voltage capacity - thicker means more kV,
thinner means less. Dotted transmission lines occur underground and the
rest are overhead.</p>

<p>Detailed analysis aside, we can see that Australia is still largely
based on non-renewables. This is unsurprising. Similarly unsurprising is
the south-east coast concentration, and proximity to densely populated
areas. Tasmania is mostly devoid of non-renewables, which is great, but
what's that large red circle in the south east? Let's take a look in
more detail.</p>
<p><a href="electricity-nsw-map.png"><img alt="NSW electrical infrastructure
map" src="electricity-nsw-map-1024x697.png"></a></p>
<p>Zooming into NSW, we can capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talbingo_Dam">Talbingo
Dam</a>, which services the
<a href="http://www.snowyhydro.com.au/energy/hydro/pumping-stations/">Tumut hydroelectric power
station</a>.
Tumut is special as it is the highest-capacity renewable power station,
and according to the <a href="https://www.resourcesandenergy.nsw.gov.au/investors/electricity-generation">list of major power
stations</a>
by the Department of Resources &amp; Energy, it has a capacity of 2,465MW.
Put into context, this is just under the 2800MW capacity of the
Bayswater coal plant, the second largest <em>non-renewable</em> power plant in
NSW.</p>
<p>All this talk about capacity is really important because most renewable
power stations have a capacity of less than 100MW. <strong>So you would have
to build say 20-40 renewable power stations to equal the capacity of a
single coal plant.</strong> If you excluded Tumut and Murray (the next high
capacity hydro after Tumut), and added up every single renewable power
plant in NSW (wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, biofuel, and biogas), you
would only then equal the capacity of your average NSW coal plant. Snowy
Hydro, which runs the show, are damn successful, and the secret is in
the name: snow makes for good hydro! All that melting and sudden runoff
is great for electricity.</p>
<p><a href="electricity-sydney-map.png"><img alt="Sydney electrical infrastructure
map" src="electricity-sydney-map-1024x722.png"></a></p>
<p>Zooming further into the Sydney region shows coal around the perimeter,
as well as the local contender which is the Warragamba dam hydro.
Despite the promise of the Warragamba dam hydro, it is important to note
that it is disconnected from the grid and only provides power when the
dam is at a certain level. This is quite a rare occasion for Warragamba,
which provides 80% of the potable water of Sydney. On my recent visit to
Warragamba, I was actually told that the hydro is being shut down due to
high operating costs. Simply put, the dam is better as a reservoir
instead of a hydro source.</p>
<p><a href="electricity-sydney-map-2.png"><img alt="Sydney electrical infrastructure map zoomed
in" src="electricity-sydney-map-2-1024x720.png"></a></p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the Sydney region. We see a spatter of
renewables and non-renewables. Still, the non-renewables outweigh the
renewables - we'll take a closer look at insolation and local solar
capacity in a future blog post, but right now the only renewables of
note are the biogases. In short, these stem off landfills (Eastern
Creek, Lucas Heights, and Spring Farm) and industrial wastelands
(Camellia). Also interesting to note is that just like the Warragamba
dam, all of these landfills are already shut down or close to shutting
down. We'll talk about the waste issue and landfill capacities in a
future blog post too.</p>
<p>In summary, Australia has a little bit more work to do. Of course, the
issue is a lot deeper than these maps, but we can't cram everything into
one blog post, so hopefully it's enough to whet your appetite.</p>

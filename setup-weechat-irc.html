<p><a href="https://weechat.org/">WeeChat</a> is an excellent extensible chat client. It
looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of weechat" src="https://thinkmoult.com/assets/weechat.png"></p>
<p>Weechat is highly configurable. It's main purpose is to connect to online <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC
chatrooms</a>. IRC
chatrooms are one of the last bastions of the democratised, wild early internet
prior to the proliferation of commercialised walled gardens that most people
live in nowadays.</p>
<p>It also connects to other chat protocols like Matrix. If your friends have been
tempted by emojis, image attachments, and other luxuries, you can still
participate nominally in their chats.</p>
<p>One of the features of IRC is that it is ephemeral. When you join a chatroom,
you will not see any messages that were posted prior to you joining. When you
leave, you will not receive any messages until you join the chatroom again. So
when you disconnect, you're really disconnecting! Nobody can contact you.</p>
<p>If this dosen't appeal to you, there are a number of strategies to retain chat
history. The easiest option is to configure WeeChat to store chat logs and
replay those chat logs when you reconnect. You'll still miss messages that
occur when you're offline, but if you're online almost 24/7, this is not much
of a concern.</p>
<pre><code># How many lines of message history to remember
/set logger.look.backlog_max_number 5000

# How many lines of message history to show when you rejoin
/set logger.look.backlog 5000

# Remember the message history ... in colour!
# Otherwise you'll only see text, and not colours that distinguish between different usernames.
/set logger.file.color_lines on
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you set this up, you'll probably have some devices that aren't
connected all the time. It'll be nice to have all devices share the same
username and see the same messages at the same time. You'll need to figure out
how to reliably be online 24/7 from a "server" and to share the same session
across any "client".</p>
<p>There are a myriad of solutions to this, including running a
<a href="https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a> or <a href="https://github.com/psybnc/psybnc">psyBNC</a>
bouncer, self-hosting <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">TheLounge</a> as a modern
interface, or using a service like <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/">IRCCloud</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll focus on using a WeeChat relay.</p>
<h2>What is a WeeChat relay?</h2>
<p>A relay is another client-server solution to keeping you connected 24/7.
Instead of your IRC client connected directly to an IRC server, it connects
first to a WeeChat relay on some external server. In turn, the WeeChat relay
connects to the IRC server.</p>
<p>You'll need a server. You can get a Virtual Private Server (VPS) for about $5
dollars per month. It's worth it!</p>
<h2>How to setup a WeeChat relay</h2>
<p>The WeeChat relay server is provided by WeeChat itself. After installing
WeeChat on your server, run it inside <code>tmux</code> and then connect to an IRC server
as usual. You can add as many servers as you want, but for now let's just add
<a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.Chat</a>.</p>
<pre><code>/server add libera irc.libera.chat
/set irc.server.libera.autoconnect on
/set irc.server.libera.autojoin_dynamic on
/set irc.server.libera.nicks &quot;YourNickname&quot;
/connect libera
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's set up a relay. It's pretty clear in the <a href="https://weechat.org/files/doc/weechat/stable/weechat_user.en.html#relay">official WeeChat relay
documentation</a>
but let's work through it together.</p>
<p>To begin with, let's create a ceritificate we can use for TLS:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/.config/weechat/tls
$ cd ~/.config/weechat/tls
$ openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout relay.pem -x509 -days 365 -out relay.pem
</code></pre>
<p>Now back inside WeeChat on your server, setup a password for your relay, and
load the certificate you generated.</p>
<pre><code>/set relay.network.password &quot;MY_PASSWORD&quot;
/relay tlscertkey
</code></pre>
<p>There are two types of relay protocols WeeChat supports. One is called <code>irc</code>,
which relays IRC channels. Another is called (confusingly) <code>weechat</code>, which
relays ... WeeChat itself. Sound confusing? Let's try again.</p>
<p>WeeChat allows external clients to connect via two protocols in relay plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>irc</code>: any IRC client can connect (including WeeChat itself running on
   another computer). It sends IRC information to these clients.</li>
<li><code>weechat</code>: only specific clients that support the <code>weechat</code> protocol can
   connect. They can see what WeeChat sees and send messages, but not much
   else. They can't join or leave channels and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that WeeChat itself <a href="https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/369">cannot connect to a WeeChat
relay</a>. If this sounds like a
strange state of affairs, that's because it is. It's a known issue and it's
being solved. There is <a href="https://specs.weechat.org/specs/2023-005-relay-http-rest-api.html">a new API
relay</a>. The
goal with API protocol is to deprecate and replace the "weechat" protocol (<a href="https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/2066">see
issue tracker</a>). You can test
out the new API relay functionality in WeeChat 4.2.2 onwards.</p>
<p>But for now, most people aren't on WeeChat 4.2.2 yet, so let's enable both
relays:</p>
<pre><code>/relay add tls.irc 8000
/relay add weechat 9000
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Your relay is setup!</p>
<h2>How to connect to a WeeChat relay</h2>
<p>Now back on your client computer, launch WeeChat. Let's get WeeChat connected
to the relay by adding a IRC server as usual ... except that the IRC server
address is the IP or domain name of your relay and uses the 8000 port. To
specify which server this is actually connecting to, you specify the server
name in the connection password as a prefix. For example, to connect to the
<code>libera</code> server we added earlier, we'd prefix the password with <code>libera:</code>.</p>
<p>Because you generated your own certificate, you can either set the
<code>tls_fingerprint</code> manually or disable <code>tls_verify</code>.</p>
<p>Then just connect as usual :)</p>
<pre><code>/server add libera YOUR_RELAY_IP_OR_DOMAIN/8000
/set irc.server.libera.password &quot;libera:MY_PASSWORD&quot;
/set irc.server.libera.tls_verify off
/connect libera
</code></pre>
<p>If you have an Android phone, an excellent client is
<a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid/">Weechat-Android</a>
available on F-Droid. It speaks the <code>weechat</code> relay protocol, so just connect
to <code>YOUR_RELAY_IP_OR_DOMAIN</code> on port <code>9000</code>.</p>

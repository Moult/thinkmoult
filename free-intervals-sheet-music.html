<p>Learning about intervals in music is a fundamental bit of theory for recognising patterns and structures in music pieces. I have produced a free PDF download of interval examples. These can be downloaded as a ZIP file and printed for any purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sheet music is notated on an A4 paper size</li>
<li>Intervals start from explaining how to get the interval number.  These are
   followed by the common intervals that are encoutered in other sheet music.</li>
<li>Extra examples demonstrate how augmented, diminished, double
augmented, and double diminished intervals work.</li>
<li>Extra examples to explain inversions of intervals and their relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample page is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="Preview of the interval sheet music" src="intervals.png"></p>
<p>The sheet has no copyright or attribution text that might
get in the way of professionalism when presenting to
students. The sheet is created using
<a href="http://www.lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>, which is quite
possibly the world's best music engraving software.</p>

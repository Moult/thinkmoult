<h2>What is an Atom feed?</h2>
<p>An Atom feed is a special online link that you can insert into a program called
a "Feed reader". A feed reader will check for updates on thinkMoult, and
whenever there is a new article, it will show up in your feed reader program.
This is less annoying that email subscriptions, does not harass you with
advertising, and faster to browse than using a web browser.</p>
<p>Imagine a completely personalised newspaper, populated by the feeds that you
find interesting. Almost all websites that publish content online offer a "feed
link", just like thinkMoult. This includes news websites, social networks, and
blogs.</p>
<p>If you have heard of RSS feeds, Atom works just like RSS does, and most feed
readers can read both Atom and RSS feeds.</p>
<p>There are many feed reader programs available for computers and phones. If you
are on Android, I can recommend
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/">Feeder</a>, and if you
are on Linux, I can recommend <a href="https://www.newsbeuter.org/">newsbeuter</a>.</p>

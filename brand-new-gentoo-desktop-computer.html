<p>It's 2018, and my 5 year old trusty <a href="../another-year-awaits/article.md">Thinkpad
420i</a> has decided to
overheat for its last time. After more than 10 years of laptops, I
decided to go for a desktop. I spoke to a fellow at <a href="https://www.linuxnow.com.au/">Linux
Now</a>, who supplies custom boxes with Linux
preinstalled, and are located in Melbourne, Australia (as of writing, no
complaints with their service at all). A week later, I was booting up
and my old laptop was headed to the nearest e-waste recycling centre.
Here's the obligatory Larry cowsay:</p>

<p>Being a desktop machine, it lacks portability but this is mitigated as
you can <a href="../installing-gentoo-android-chroot/article.md">run Gentoo on your
phone</a>. Combine
your phone with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and you have a full-on
portable workstation. Your desktop will be much more powerful than your
laptop, at half the price.</p>
<p><img alt="Tower machine" src="20180105_150558.jpg"></p>
<p>And of course, here are the hardware specs.</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5 1600X CPU (<a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B%5D=757&amp;cmp%5B%5D=3000">5 times
    faster</a>
    than my laptop) As of writing, these Ryzens are experiencing some
    instability related to <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196683">kernel bug
    196683</a>, but the
    workarounds in the bug report seem to solve it.</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti GPU (<a href="https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B%5D=117&amp;cmp%5B%5D=3595">16 times
    faster</a>
    than my laptop). Yes, proprietary blob drivers are in use.</li>
<li>16GB DDR4 2400Mhz RAM</li>
<li>250GB SSD</li>
<li>23.6in 1920x1080 16:9 LCD Monitor</li>
<li>Filco Majestouch-2, Tenkeyless keyboard. If you've never needed a
    clean-cut professional mechanical keyboard that isn't as bulky as
    the <a href="http://thinkmoult.com/the-one-and-only-ibm-model-m-keyboard/">IBM Model
    M</a>,
    I'd highly recommend this one.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Filco Majestouch-2, Tenkeyless keyboard" src="20180105_153207.jpg"></p>
<p>Software-wise, it is running <a href="http://gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> with
<a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a>. Backup server is hosted by
<a href="http://rsync.net/">rsync.net</a>. The worldfile is largely the same as my
old laptop, with the addition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsbeuter">newsbeuter</a> for RSS feeds.
Happy 2018!</p>

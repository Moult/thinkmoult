                Physical objects in an IFC file must be categorised to a class of object, which has implications on what properties are expected to be found on the object. This tool lets you type what type of object you have, and it will try and find the right IFC class for you.

                A detailed explanation of how colours work in IFC. Colours seem deceptively simple, but are often confused with physical materials. Colours may be used for simple shading, rendering, and light simulation.

                This is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of IFC files and explains how to improve data exports from Autodesk Revit to IFC. Out of the box, Revit IFC support is very limited, but it can be mitigated using an open-source plugin and understanding these undocumented quirks.

                Revit is a proprietary software package developed by Autodesk, an industry monopoly that consistently underdelivers when architects, engineers, and builders attempt to execute a BIM project. With OpenBIM still yet to mature, here is a list of criticisms of the software&#x27;s limitations.

                This posts compares Radiance with modern rendering engines, such as Renderman and Autodesk Insight. Radiance is seen as the gold standard for light simulation, but more modern engines are becoming more physically based and claim photorealistic results at a fraction of the time. Why should we use one over the other?
